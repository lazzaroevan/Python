Arthroleptella rugosa is a species of frog in the family Pyxicephalidae. It is endemic to South Africa and only known from the Klein Swartberg Mountain, an inselberg near Caledon, Western Cape. The specific name rugosa is Latin for wrinkled or rough and refers to the rough appearance of this species (caused by distinct glandular tubercles ) as well as its rough sounding advertisement call. Accordingly, common name rough moss frog has been suggested for it.
