Unfree labour, or forced labour, is any work relation, especially in modern or early modern history, in which people are employed against their will with the threat of destitution, detention, violence including death, compulsion, or other forms of extreme hardship to themselves or members of their families.
Unfree labour includes all forms of slavery, penal labour and the corresponding institutions, such as debt slavery, serfdom, corv√©e and labour camps.
