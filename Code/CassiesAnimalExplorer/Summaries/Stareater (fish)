Snaggletooths or stareaters are any of a number of small, deep-sea stomiid fish in the genus Astronesthes. They possess a bioluminescent red chin barbel that the fish use as a lure to attract small prey into striking distance.
The fish have delicate skin, and mouths filled with sharp, needlelike, curved teeth.
