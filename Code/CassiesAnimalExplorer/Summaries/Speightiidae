Speightiidae is an extinct taxonomic family of fossil sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks.
This family is not assigned to a superfamily. It has been traditionally classified near the family Turridae. But in 1993 it was shown that many, if not all, species that were placed in this family should instead be placed in the family Fasciolariidae.
