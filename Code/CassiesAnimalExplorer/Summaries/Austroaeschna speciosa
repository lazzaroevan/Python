Austroaeschna speciosa is a species of dragonfly in the family Telephlebiidae, 
known as the tropical unicorn darner. It is known to be present only in the mountainous regions of north-east Queensland, Australia. It appears very similar to the more widespread Austroaeschna unicornis (unicorn darner) which inhabits areas in southern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.
