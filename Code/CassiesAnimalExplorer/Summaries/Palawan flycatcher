The Palawan flycatcher (Ficedula platenae) is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae.
It is endemic to the Philippines.
Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
It is threatened by habitat loss.
With a population currently between 6,000-15,000, the Palawan Flycatcher has attracted help from conservation groups.  These groups have created protected areas on these islands where logging can't occur.  By doing this, the primary source of their decline is lessened.  Conservation groups attempted to cultivate and restore the lands which their species was wiped from.  Unlike most species, the Palawan Flycatcher did not return to these lands after the restoration back to old growth.Call:
The Palawan Flycatcher has a very unusual and distinct call.  This call starts out with a high pitched "zee-ee" which gets repeated anywhere from 10-15 times in quick repetition.  Then it gets followed by a short 5-10 second trill.  The bird also will fan out and shake its tail while doing this call.  This call very insect-like call often gets mistaken as an insect's call.
