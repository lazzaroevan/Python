Gastrotheca testudinea (common name: Espada's marsupial frog) is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae. It has a widespread latitudinal range along the eastern (Amazonian) slopes of the Andes of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.An arboreal direct-development marsupial frog, G. testudinea dwells in foothill, low montane, and cloud forests at elevations from 700–2,775 m (2,297–9,104 ft) above sea level. Despite its wide distribution, Gastrotheca testudinea is seldom collected or recorded, probably due to its arboreal habits, and much remains to be known about its distribution and natural history. Habitat loss is a threat to it.
