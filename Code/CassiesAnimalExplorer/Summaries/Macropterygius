Macropterygius is a genus of ichthyosaurs known from the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian age) of England (Kimmeridge Clay formation). Though many specimens have been referred to this genus from all over Europe, the type specimen of the only recognized species, M. trigonus, consists of just a single vertebra. Because this cannot be used to distinguish ichthyosaurs from one another, the genus and species are currently considered nomena dubia (doubtful names).
