Crocodilaemus is an extinct genus of pholidosaurid mesoeucrocodylian. Fossils have been found from the Cerin Lagerst√§tte of eastern France and are of late Kimmeridgian age. The depositional environment in Cerin at the time is thought to have been the bottom of a lagoon that was enclosed by an emergent reef complex, evidence of the shallow tropical sea that covered much of western Europe during the Jurassic period.
