Hunyadiscus saurini is a species of air-breathing land snails, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family Plectopylidae. The specific name saurini is in honour of French geologist and malacologist Edmond Saurin (1904â€“1977), who collected type material. Saurin's type material is as of 2016 the only known material of this species.
