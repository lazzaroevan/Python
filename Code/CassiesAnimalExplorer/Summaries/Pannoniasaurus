Pannoniasaurus is an extinct genus of tethysaurine mosasauroid known from the Late Cretaceous Csehb√°nya Formation (Santonian stage) of Hungary. It contains a single species, Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus, dubbed "unexpected" because it was discovered in freshwater sediments, unlike other mosasaurs, which were marine predators. It was a medium-sized mosasaur, reaching up to 6 m (20 ft) in length.
