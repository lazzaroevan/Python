Conus figulinus, common name the fig cone, is a cone snail, a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
Dendroconus buxeus, Dendroconus glaucus and Dendroconus loroisii are all very similar to Conus figulinus, but are considered each a unique species.
