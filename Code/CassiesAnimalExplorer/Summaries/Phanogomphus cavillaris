The Sandhill Clubtail (Phanogomphus cavillaris) is a species of Clubtail Dragonfly endemic to the Southeastern United States, found from Central Peninsular Florida to Southern Alabama as well as some of North Carolina. Adult individuals are found in scrub-like or other dry, sandy, lightly vegetated habitats located near a stream or lake. Just like most other Gomphids, the Sandhill Clubtail has an enlarged end of the abdomen as well as eyes located farther apart than the average Anisoptera.
