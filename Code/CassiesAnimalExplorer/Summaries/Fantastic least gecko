The fantastic least gecko (Sphaerodactylus fantasticus) is a species of gecko found in the Caribbean, on the islands of Dominica, Montserrat, and the Guadeloupe archipelago.  Nine subspecies have been described, each of which has a very restricted range and varies in coloration and other physical characteristics.
On Dominica, the distribution of the subspecies S. fantasticus fuga is limited to the western coast (Malhotra and Thorpe 1999). These dwarf geckos have recently been found to be genetically similar to one population on Guadeloupe, suggesting that they are recent colonizers of Dominica (Malhotra and Thorpe 1999; Thorpe et al. 2008).
