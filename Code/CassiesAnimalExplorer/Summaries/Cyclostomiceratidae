Cylostomiceratidae is a family of Early Ordovician, (Cassinian), ellesmerocerid cephalopods characterized by short, essentially straight shells, a fairly rapidly expanding phragmocone and a ventral siphuncle in which septal necks are almost non-existent and connecting rings are thick and layered. As typical of the Ellesmerocerida, chambers are short, septa close spaced.
