The small mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma muscatellum) is a species of bat in the Rhinopomatidae family. It is found in Afghanistan, Iran, Oman, and possibly Ethiopia. 
The small mouse-tailed bat ranges from the Seistan basin in Iran well into the Helmand River basin of south-western Afghanistan.Mouse tailed bats have a wingspan of 17–25 cm, a body length of 6–8 cm and a tail the same length as its body. Their diet is flying insects which they eat whilst flying. 
This species was demonstrated as distinct from R. hardwickei based on mutually exclusive morphological features: the small mouse-tailed bat has a nearly unridged skull with small teeth and large cavities filled with  fluid.
