The Apusomonadida are a group of protozoan zooflagellates that glide on surfaces, and mostly consume prokaryotes.  They are of particular evolutionary interest because they appear to be the sister group to the Opisthokonts, the clade as that includes both animals and fungi. Together with the Breviatea, these form the Obazoa clade.
