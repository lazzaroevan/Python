It is found in Cameroon and Nigeria.The length of the forewings is 20–23 mm for males and 23.5–25 mm for females. The forewings are buff, reddish buff or grey, lightly speckled with dark brown. The medial shade is reddish buff, brown or grey and there is a brown or reddish brown oblique postmedial fascia, as well as a trace of a broad dentate subterminal fascia. There are also hyaline greenish patches and a similarly coloured discocellular spot, a spot in the middle of the cell and a dark spot just distal to the anterior angle of the cell.
