Duboisia santeng or Dubois' antelope is an extinct antelope-like bovid that was endemic to Indonesia during the Pleistocene. It went extinct during the Ionian stage of the Pleistocene, about 750.000 years ago. Duboisia santeng was first described by the Dutch paleoanthropologist and geologist Eug√®ne Dubois in 1891.The species is most closely related to the modern Nilgai-antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and the Four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis). Antilope modjokertensis is a junior synonym for Duboisia santeng.
