Spialia orbifer, the orbed red-underwing skipper or Hungarian skipper is a butterfly of the family Hesperiidae. It is found from south-eastern Europe and temperate Asia to Korea. The habitat consists of steppe on plains and grassy slopes in the mountains.
This has sometimes been treated as a subspecies of Spialia sertorius but can be distinguished by the olive green (rather than reddish-brown) underside of the hindwing.
The wingspan is 24â€“28 mm. Adults are on wing from April to August in one or two generations per year.The larvae feed on Rubus idaeus, Sanguisorba officinalis, Sanguisorba minor and Potentilla gelida.
