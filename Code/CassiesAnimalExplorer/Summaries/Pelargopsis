"Pelargopsis" was also invalidly given to Pelargopappus, a genus of fossil secretarybirds.

Pelargopsis is a genus of  tree kingfishers that are resident in tropical south Asia from India and Sri Lanka to Indonesia.
The genus was introduced by the German zoologist Constantin Gloger in 1841. The type species is a subspecies of the stork-billed kingfisher Pelargopsis capensis javana. The word Pelargopsis  is derived from the classical Greek pelargos meaning "stork" and opsis meaning "appearance".The genus contains three species:

These three kingfishers were previously placed in the genus Halcyon.These are large kingfishers, 35 cm (14 in) in length. They have very large red or black bills and bright red legs. The head and underparts of these species are white or buff, and the wings and back are darker, coloured variously in green and blue, brown or black depending on species. The sexes are similar. The flight of the Pelargopsis kingfishers is flapping, but direct.
Pelargopsis kingfishers inhabit a variety of well-wooded habitats near lakes, rivers, estuaries or coasts. They perch quietly whilst seeking food, and are often inconspicuous despite their size. They are territorial and will chase away eagles and other large predators. These species hunts crabs, fish, frogs, and in the case of stork-billed at least, rodents and young birds.
Pelargopsis kingfishers excavate their nests in a river bank, decaying tree, or a tree termite nest and lay round white eggs.
