Photoblepharon palpebratum, the eyelight fish or one-fin flashlightfish, is a species of saltwater anomalopid fish of the order Beryciformes. It is native to the western and central Pacific Ocean where it is found along seaward reefs close to the ocean floor, usually near rocks and corals it can use as cover. At only 12.0 cm (4.7 in) in length, it is a small fish, and more stout than other members of its family. Its body is mostly black, with a line of reflective scales running the length of its body and a distinguishing white spot at the upper corner of its preopercle. Its most notable features are its subocular bioluminescent organs which it likely uses to attract and find prey, confuse predators, and communicate with other fish. These organs are blinked on and off by the fish using a dark lid that slides up to cover them.
The eyelight fish is a nocturnal predator, spending the day hidden in caves and crevices in the rock, and emerging at night to search for food. It generally hunts in large groups away from the reef. Like other members of its family, its reproduction is oviparous. Mated spairs spawn near the ocean surface and females can produce as many as 1,000 eggs per cycle. It is of little commercial value to fisheries, its only real use being as bait for local fishermen, but has been displayed in public aquariums. It is listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature because its nocturnal habits make its collection difficult and sightings uncommon.
