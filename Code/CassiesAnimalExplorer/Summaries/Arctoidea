Arctoidea is an infraorder of mostly carnivorous mammals which include the extinct Hemicyonidae (dog-bears), and the extant Musteloidea (weasels, raccoons, skunks, red pandas), Pinnipedia (seals, sea lions), and Ursidae (bears), found in all continents from the Eocene, 46 million years ago, to the present.
Arctoids are caniforms, along with dogs (canids) and extinct bear dogs (Amphicyonidae).
The earliest caniforms were superficially similar to martens, which are tree-dwelling mustelids.
Together with feliforms, caniforms comprise the order Carnivora, sometimes Arctoidea can be considered a separate suborder from Caniformia and a sister taxon to Feliformia.
