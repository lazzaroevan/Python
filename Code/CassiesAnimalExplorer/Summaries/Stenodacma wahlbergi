Stenodacma wahlbergi is a moth of the family Pterophoridae described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1851. It is known from Japan (Honshu, Kyushu, Tsushima), China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Sri Lanka, India, Central, East and South Africa, St. Helena, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Rodriguez Island. It has recently been recorded from Vietnam. Records for Australia were based on synonymisation with Stenodacma pyrrhodes.
The length of the forewings is 6â€“7 mm. Adults emerge from April to October in Japan.
The larvae feed on Oxalis species (including Oxalis corniculata), Ipomoea batatas and  Vitaceae (Vitis indica). They feed on the leaf and pod of the host plant.
