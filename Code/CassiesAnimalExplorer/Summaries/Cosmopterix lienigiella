The wingspan is 10â€“13 mm.The forewings are light brownish ochreous; costal and dorsal edges white ; a fine white longitudinal subcostal line from costa near base to 1/3, another along fold from base to middle, and a short one beneath posterior extremity of this ; a somewhat brighter fascia beyond middle,narrowed dorsally, edged with pale golden metallic streaks, posterior interrupted, anterior followed by a variable black spot above middle ; a white longitudinal streak from near beyond this to apex. Hindwings are grey.The larva is rosy-whitish, sometimes with rosy transverse

Adults are on wing from September to April.
The larvae feed on Phragmites australis. They mine the leaves of their host plant.

Pupation takes place in a cocoon in the top section of the mine.
