Sri Lanka petite shrub frog, (Pseudophilautus tanu), is a species of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae, endemic to southwestern Sri Lanka. This relatively recently described species is only known from two locations in the Galle District, Beraliya and Kanneliya Forest Reserves. The specific name tanu is Sinhalese for "slender" and refers to the habitus of this frog.
