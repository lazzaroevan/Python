Secutor insidiator, the pugnose ponyfish or barred ponyfish, is a species of ray-finned fish, a ponyfish in the family Leiognathidae. The barred ponyfish's mineralized skeleton contains apatite and the mineralized tissue contains hydroxylapatite. They have bare heads with nuchal spines and their bodies are a distinctive, reflective silver, frequently imitated by fishermen using silver lures. They have a protracted mouth pointing upward and the tip of the maxilla reaches well below the level of the lower margin of the eye. Barred ponyfish feed on zooplankton, including larval fishes and crustaceans. Body depth is twice or slightly more than standard length, which measures 11.3 cm from the tip of the snout to last vertebra. The lateral line ends before the dorsal fin.
