Philippen's striped turtle, "Mauremys" philippeni, has recently shown to be an intergeneric hybrid (Stuart & Parham, 2006) between a male Mauremys sinensis and a female Cuora trifasciata.
The "species" is known only from a handful of specimens (mainly the type series), said to originate from Hainan, but all acquired from a pet trader in Hong Kong.
