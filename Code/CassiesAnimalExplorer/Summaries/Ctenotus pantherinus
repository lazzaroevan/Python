Ctenotus pantherinus, commonly known as the leopard ctenotus, is a species of skink endemic to central and western Australia. Ctenotus Pantherinus is commonly known to reproductively be the only species (within the Ctenotus genus) to have a female be smaller in size in comparison to their male counterparts. This has allowed them to both adequately adapt to their environment, as well as, caused them to sustain their population growth.
