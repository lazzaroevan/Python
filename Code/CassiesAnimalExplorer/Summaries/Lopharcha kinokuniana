Lopharcha kinokuniana is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae. It is found in Japan on the island of Honshu.
The wingspan is 11â€“15 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is dark brown, overlaid with brown and with reddened metallic transverse strigulae (fine streaks). The hindwings are greyish-brown, but whitish basally.
The larvae feed on Cinnamomum japonicum. They fold the leaves of their host plant, constructing a sword-like case. They feed on the tops of the inner surfaces within the case.
