Apsat (also Avsati or Æfsati; Georgian: აფსათი) is a male deity of birds and animals in the mythology of the peoples of the Caucasus. His name may come from the Abkhaz language word a-psaatʷ, meaning "bird", or possibly from the name of the Christian saint with whom he was popularly associated, Saint Eustathios. Some sources regard him as responsible for all hunted game, while others consider him to watch over fish and birds specifically. In some cycles, he is the primary hunting god, while in others, he is part of a pantheon of hunting deities. A few sources connect him with thunder and lightning.
