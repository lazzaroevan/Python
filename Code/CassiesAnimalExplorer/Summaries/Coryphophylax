Coryphophylax is an agamid genus endemic to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and a sister of the Southeast Asian Aphaniotis. Found in tropical wet forests,  they are common in suitable habitats and shows variations across islands and are sexually dimorphic. The genus is absent on Great Nicobar Island, with its southernmost occurrence on the Island of Kondul. The Tsunami of December 2004 may have affected island wise distributions in the Nicobar Islands of several species and also their gene-flow.
