Spelaeornis, the typical wren-babblers, is a bird genus in the family Timaliidae. Among this group, the typical wren-babblers are quite closely related to the type species, the chestnut-capped babbler (Timalia pileata). One species that was earlier placed in the genus, the spotted elachura has been removed to a genus of its own Elachura and placed in a separate family.
