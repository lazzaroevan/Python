Parvimolge is a genus of salamanders in the family Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders. It is currently considered as monotypic, although this may yet change as molecular data suggest that it is embedded within a paraphyletic Pseudoeurycea. Parvimolge townsendi is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental in central and southern Veracruz, Mexico. It is represented by the species Parvimolge townsendi, commonly known as Townsend's dwarf salamander.
