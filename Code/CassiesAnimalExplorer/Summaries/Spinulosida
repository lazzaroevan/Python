The Spinulosida are an order of sea stars containing at least 120 species in seven genera and two families.
Spinulosids completely lack pedicellariae and have a delicate skeletal arrangement. Their name comes from the presence of numerous low spines on the aboral (upper) surface. No fossil spinulosids have yet been found.
