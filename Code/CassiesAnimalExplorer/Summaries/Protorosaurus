Protorosaurus ("first lizard") is a genus of lizard-like early archosauromorph reptiles. Members of the genus lived during the late Permian period in Germany and Brazil. Once believed to have been an ancestor to lizards, Protorosaurus is now known to be one of the oldest members of the lineage that would eventually lead to archosaurs such as crocodilians and dinosaurs.
