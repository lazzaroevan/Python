The little rock thrush (Monticola rufocinereus) is a passerine bird in the family Muscicapidae. It is found in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Yemen. It is found in rocky areas with some trees, and sometimes near settlements. At 15 to 16 centimetres (5.9 to 6.3 in) this is the smallest of the rock thrushes. The male has the head, throat and upper mantle blue-grey, the underparts orange-red, except for the centre blackish centre tail and tips which form an inverted T shape. The female is duller and paler. It is readily mistaken for a redstart because of its habit of trembling its tail.
