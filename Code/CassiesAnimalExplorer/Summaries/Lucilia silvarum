The common toad fly, Lucilia silvarum, is a member of the fly family Calliphoridae. This fly was first discovered by Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1826 and is found most notably in European and Western Countries.
This species of fly is known for its ability to readily cause myiasis, specifically this is done by the female gender of this species. In addition to being a species prevalent in myiasis, this fly is also known to be prevalent around rotting bodies as it is attracted to their smell, as well as areas of high filth concentration.
