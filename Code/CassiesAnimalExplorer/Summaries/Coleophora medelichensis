Coleophora medelichensis is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found from the Czech Republic to the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and Crete and from France to Romania.
The larvae feed on Dorycnium pentaphyllum germanicum and on Dorycnium pentaphyllum herbaceum. They create a laterally compressed composite leaf case, made up of 4-6 mined leaflets. It is not narrowed posteriorly. The case is 6–7 mm long and has a mouth angle of about 45°. The mouth opening is shifted to the side, causing the leaf to lie flat on the broad side. Larvae can be found from August to June in two overlapping generations.
