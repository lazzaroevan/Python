Drymusa is a genus of false violin spiders that was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1892. They physically resemble violin spiders (Loxosceles), but their bites are not believed to be medically significant. Originally placed with the spitting spiders, it was moved to the Loxoscelidae (now a synonym for Sicariidae) in 1981, then to the Drymusidae in 1986.
