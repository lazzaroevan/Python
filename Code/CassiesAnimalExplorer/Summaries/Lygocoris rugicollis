Lygocoris rugicollis is a widespread, common species of bug in the Miridae family. It feeds on a large variety of bushes and small trees, but especially willows (members of the Salicaceae) and slightly less often alders (members of the Betulaceae).  It can be found throughout Europe, including the UK, and Spain, in North Africa, as far east as Central Asia, in Alaska and Canada, including the Maritimes.
