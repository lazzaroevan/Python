The Indian Grain Aphid (Sitobion miscanthi), also known as Sitobion (Sitobion) miscanthi, is an aphid in the superfamily Aphidoidea in the order Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap from cereal plants, making it a pest of wheat production. A high-quality draft of the S. miscanthi genome 377.19 Mb in size was sequenced to help promote research on the lifestyle and feeding specificity of aphids and their interactions with each other and species at other trophic levels.
