The dusky crawler (Sticharium clarkae) is a species of clinid native to the coast of southern Australia, where it lives around coastal outcrops in which it can find partially sheltered, sandy bays.  It can be found at depths from 5 to 10 m (16 to 33 ft).  It can reach a maximum total length of 8 cm (3.1 in). The specific name of this  clinid honours  ichthyologist  Eugenie Clark (1922-2015) of the University of Maryland.
