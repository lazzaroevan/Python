The spot-bellied bobwhite (Colinus leucopogon) is a ground-dwelling bird in the New World quail family. It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the crested bobwhite, Colinus cristatus. As the latter species expands north into Costa Rica, it is likely that the two species will overlap in range in the future, but the Costa Rican subspecies of the spot-bellied is the least similar to the crested.
The spot-bellied bobwhite occurs in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,  Nicaragua and Costa Rica in open savanna with bushes and trees and other open woodland.
