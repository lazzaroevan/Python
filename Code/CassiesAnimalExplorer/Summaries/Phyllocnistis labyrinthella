Phyllocnistis labyrinthella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is found in most of Europe, except the British Isles, Italy, the Mediterranean Islands and parts of the Balkan Peninsula.

The wingspan is 6â€“7 mm.
The larvae mine the leaves of Populus alba and Populus tremula. The mine consists of a very long, broad epidermal corridor that winds in dense loops over the upperside (and often also the underside) of the leaf without ever intersecting intself. The frass is deposited in a continuous brownish-black central line. The corridor ends at the leaf margin, where it widens somewhat while the leaf margin folds over.
