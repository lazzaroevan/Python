The cream-colored woodpecker (Celeus flavus) is unmistakably recognizable by its pale but distinct yellow plumage and beak, long erect crest, dark brown wings and black tail. The male is differentiated by the female by its thick bright red malar stripe. The yellow plumage may darken to a browner or darker tone if soiled. The cream-colored woodpecker is 24–26 centimetres (9.4–10.2 in) in height and weighs 95–130 grams (3.4–4.6 oz).
