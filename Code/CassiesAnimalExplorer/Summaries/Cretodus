Cretodus is an extinct genus of mackerel sharks belonging to the proposed family Pseudoscapanorhynchidae. It lived during the Late Cretaceous, approximately 100 to 89 million years ago. The genus is best known from formations formed in the Western Interior Seaway, but is also known from the late Cretaceous of Europe, Africa, and possibly Asia. It is mainly known from isolated teeth and vertebral centra, though a few associated dentitions and spines have been found.
