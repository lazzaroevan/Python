Steganocerus multipunctatus Thunberg 1783, or Ladybird Bug is a Sub-Saharan African member of the Hemiptera with a strong resemblance to a Ladybird. It is normally black with bright orange spots, but is quite variable in colour and may be brown without spots. It shares MÃ¼llerian mimicry with the Tortoise beetle Chiridopsis suffriani, and a spider Paraplectana thorntoni.S. multipunctatus is one of the Rhynchota whose presence has been recorded on a wide range of indigenous plants and cultivated crops such as cotton.
