The Fijian monkey-faced bat or Fijian flying fox (Mirimiri acrodonta) is a megabat endemic to Fiji. It was discovered in old-growth cloud forest on Des VÅ“ux Peak, the second highest mountain peak (1,195 m) on the island of Taveuni by William and Ruth Beckon in 1976, and is Fiji's only endemic mammal.  It has recently been transferred from Pteralopex to its own monotypic genus Mirimiri.
