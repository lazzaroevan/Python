Scutuloidea kutu is a species of marine isopods in the family Sphaeromatidae, first described by Stephenson and Riley in 1996. No subspecies are listed in the Catalog of Life. The name "kutu" (Māori for "lice") was chosen as a metaphor, as the species lives on seaweed (i.e. the hair of hinemoana, a personification of the ocean).
