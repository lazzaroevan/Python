The Palawan shrew (Crocidura palawanensis) is a species of mammal in the family Soricidae. It is endemic to the Philippines and known from Palawan and Balabac Islands, from sea level to 1,300 m (4,300 ft) asl. It occurs in old growth and scrubby secondary forest. Habitat loss (deforestation) is a potential threat to this little known species, although it seems to tolerate habitat loss and modification.
