Patagosuchus is an extinct genus of peirosaurid crocodyliform known from the early Late Cretaceous Portezuelo Formation of Neuqu√©n Province, western central Argentina. It contains a single species, Patagosuchus anielensis. It is distinguished from other peirosaurids by its extremely heterodont dentition, which includes small serrated teeth at the front of the jaws with much larger, laterally compressed caniniform teeth behind them. Patagosuchus also has large spaces between its teeth called interalveolar spaces that are not found in any other peirosaurid.
