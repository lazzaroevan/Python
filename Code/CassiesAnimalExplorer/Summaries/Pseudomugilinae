The Pseudomugilidae, the blue-eyes, are a subfamily of atheriniform fish in the Melanotaeniidae, related to the rainbowfishes. They inhabit fresh and brackish water in Australia, New Guinea and nearby smaller islands. Blue-eyes are small fish, typically no more than 5 cm (2.0 in) in length. Like rainbowfish, they spawn all year round, and attach their eggs to vegetation.
