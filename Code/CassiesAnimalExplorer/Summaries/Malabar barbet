The Malabar barbet (Psilopogon malabaricus) is an Asian barbet native to the Western Ghats in India.
It was formerly treated as a race of the crimson-fronted barbet (Psilopogon rubricapillus). It overlaps in some places with the range of the coppersmith barbet (Psilopogon haemacephala) and has a similar but more rapid call.
