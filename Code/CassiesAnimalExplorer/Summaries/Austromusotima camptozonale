Austromusotima camptozonale, the climbing maidhair pyralid moth, is a moth of the family Crambidae. It is native to Australia, but attempts have been made to introduce it to southern Florida as a biological control agent for Old World climbing fern.

The wingspan is about 10 mm.
The larvae feed on Lygodium microphyllum, Lygodium japonicum and Lygodium palmatum.
