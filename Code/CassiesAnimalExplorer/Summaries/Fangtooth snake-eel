The fangtooth snake-eel (Aplatophis chauliodus), also known as the tusky eel in Cuba and the United States, is an eel in the family Ophichthidae. It was described by James Erwin Böhlke in 1956. It is a marine, tropical eel known from the western Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and French Guiana. It dwells at a depth range of 33–91 m (100–300 ft), and dwells in both marine waters and brackish estuaries. It inhabits burrows on a permanent or semipermanent basis, and leaves its eyes and snout exposed. Males can reach a maximum total length of 84 cm (33 in). The fangtooth snake-eel's diet consists of bony fish and crustaceans.A dead specimen of what was probably a fangtooth snake-eel, or possibly a garden or conger eel, was found washed up on a beach in Texas City, Texas, US following Hurricane Harvey in 2017.
