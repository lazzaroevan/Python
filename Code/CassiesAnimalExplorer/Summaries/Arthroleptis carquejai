Arthroleptis carquejai is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is known with certainty only from northwestern Angola, but there is also a recent record from Gabon. If this is correct, its distribution might also include intervening areas in the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The specific name carquejai honours Bento Carqueja, Portuguese professor, journalist, and philanthropist. Common names Cambondo screeching frog and Carqueja's squeaker have been proposed for it.
