Mammuthus lamarmorai is a species of mammoth which lived during the late Middle and Upper Pleistocene (between 450,000 and perhaps 40,000 years) on the island of Sardinia. M. lamarmorai is a dwarf species, as it is estimated to have reached a shoulder height of only 1.4 m and weighed about 550 kg. This pygmy mammoth has been found  mostly in the fine-grained sediments of the western part of the island.
