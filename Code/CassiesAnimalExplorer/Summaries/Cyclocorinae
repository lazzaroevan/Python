The Cyclocorinae are a subfamily of lamprophiid snakes endemic to the Philippines. It was erected in 2017 to house 4 enigmatic, endemic genera containing 7 species and one undescribed lineage that are more closely related to one another than to members of the subfamilies Atractaspidinae and Aparallactinae or to other subfamilies of Lamprophiidae. Previously placed within Colubridae, a 2017 study by Weinell et al. found strong support the monophyly of Cyclocorinae within Lamprophiidae, but its position relative to the other subfamilies of Lamprophiidae is not resolved. Cyclocorinae was found to be a possible sister group to Atractaspidinae. Despite high support for a close relationship from DNA, there are no unambiguous morphological characteristics that unite these four genera. A fifth genus, Levitonius, was described in 2020.The species of Cyclocorinae likely began to diverge beginning ∼35 mya (CI 29–41 mya). Because snakes of this subfamily are not known from Palawan Island, their method of dispersal from mainland Asia to the Philippine archipelago must have differed from that of most Philippine reptiles and amphibians, which are thought to have rafted over on the Palawan "Ark".The members of this subfamily are among the most poorly-known snakes in the world. Very little data is available on their geographic distribution, ecology, behavior, or conservation status.
