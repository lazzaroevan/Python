Mareca is a genus or subgenus of duck in the family Anatidae that includes the wigeons.
The species now placed in this genus were formerly placed in the genus Anas. A molecular phylogentic study comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2009 found that the genus Anas, as then defined, was non-monophyletic. Based on the published phylogeny, the genus Anas was split into four monophyletic genera with five extant species moved into the resurrected genus Mareca.The genus Mareca was introduced by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens in 1824.  The type species is the Eurasian wigeon. The name of the genus is from the Brazilian-Portuguese word Marr√©co for a small duck.
