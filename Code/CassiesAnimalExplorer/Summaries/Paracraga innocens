Paracraga innocens is a moth in the family Dalceridae. It was described by Schaus in 1905. It is found in Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana and northern Brazil (Amazon Basin). The habitat consists of tropical moist and tropical premontane wet forests.
The length of the forewings is 9–11 mm for males and 12–14 mm for females. The forewings are white, suffused with rusty brown. There is a rusty patch along the costal margin past the end of the discal cell and a thin wavy brown line across the cell, around a brown spot and back down the wing to the anal angle. There are also brown dots on the veins at the outer margin and a brown dot near the base. The hindwings are white with brown marginal shading at the anal angle. Adults are on wing from October to July.
