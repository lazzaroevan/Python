Stenoma stephanodes is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931. It is found in French Guiana.The wingspan is about 32 mm for females and 28 mm for males. The forewings of the females are yellow ochreous with a dark brown irregular streak along the costa throughout and irregular ferruginous-brown suffusion beneath it occupying most of the costal half, especially a very oblique series of irregular spots from before the middle of the costa terminating in a ferruginous blotch beyond the cell, preceded by two or three dots, and a waved line near the costa from beyond the middle to the apex, continued by a waved ferruginous-ochreous shade near the termen to before the tornus. There is also an interrupted ferruginous terminal line. The hindwings of the females are light ochreous, tinged grey. Males have dark fuscous forewings, thickly overlaid and almost concealed with long brownish-ochreous hairscales and markings as in females, but dark brown and indistinct. The hindwings of the males are dark fuscous.
