Apollonaster kelleyi is a species of abyssal sea star in the family Goniasteridae. It was discovered in 2015 in the Hawaiian region. It is identified as part of the Apollonaster genus based on its bare abactinal plate surfaces and multiple accessory granule rows on its abactinal plates. The species name Kelleyi was chosen in honor of Dr. Christopher Kelley, director of the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory.
