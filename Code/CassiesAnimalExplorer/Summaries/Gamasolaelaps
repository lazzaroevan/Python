Gamasolaelaps is a genus of mites belonging to the family Veigaiidae. Males of this genus can be distinguished from other members of the family by the lack of spurs on the second pair of legs and the fact the sclerotized shields on the underside of the body are never fused together. Females are more difficult to diagnose, a high powered microscope being required.
