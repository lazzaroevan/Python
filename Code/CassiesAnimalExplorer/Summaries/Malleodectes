Malleodectes is a genus of unusual marsupial species, first discovered in 2011 at Riversleigh, Queensland, Australia. It could grow as large as a ferret, and lived in the Miocene, 17 million years ago. The reason for its name, which means "Hammer Biter", is because it has blunt, hammer like teeth, not known from any other mammal extant or extinct. However, Scott Hocknull from the Queensland Museum has noticed similarities to the modern pink-tongued skink (Cyclodomorphus gerrardii), a reptile specialised for eating snails. This suggests that Malleodectes too was a specialised snail hunter.
