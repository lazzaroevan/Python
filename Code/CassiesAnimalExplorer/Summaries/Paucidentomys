Paucidentomys is a genus of rodents of a type commonly known as shrew-rats which was discovered in 2012 in a remote rainforest on the Indonesian island, Sulawesi. The genus is monotypic, consisting of the species Paucidentomys vermidax. The name, which is Latin and may be translated as "worm-eating few-toothed mouse", refers to the fact that they have only two teeth and may live exclusively on a diet of earthworms.
