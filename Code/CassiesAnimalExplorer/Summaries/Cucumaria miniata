Cucumaria miniata is commonly known as the orange sea cucumber or red sea cucumber due to its striking color.  This northeast Pacific species is often found wedged in between rocks or crevices at the coast or on docks and can generally be identified by its orange bushy tentacles protruding above the substrate.
