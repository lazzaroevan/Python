Busseola fusca is a species of moth that is also known as the maize stalk borer. It is known from Ethiopia.
The wingspan is 35–40 mm. Adults are pale brown.
The caterpillars are light or dark violet to pinkish white and about 1 to 2 ½ cm. The caterpillars feed in the leaf hearts (leaf funnels) at the vegetative crop stage. The damage is visible as yellowish and dying leaf hearts. Later, larvae bore into the stems.  The boring tunnels are seen when you slice the stems. Later, stalk borers also tunnel into grains.The caterpillar feeding kills the growing points of the plant.  Caterpillars also carry Fusarium fungi to the cobs, which can produce mycotoxins. If not controlled, stalk borers cause yield loss between 20 - 100% in maize.The larvae feed on various grasses, as well as Zea mays, Sorghum and Saccharum species.
