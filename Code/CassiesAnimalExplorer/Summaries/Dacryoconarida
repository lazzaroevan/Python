Dacryoconarida is an extinct subclass of free living animals from the Tentaculita class, 
which were common in the Devonian oceans (Fisher, 1962). Dacryoconarids have a subspherical, 
drop- or tear-shaped embryonic chamber (Farsan 2005). Their affinity is unknown; 
they have often been placed among molluscs. Their fossils
are known from Devonian rocks of Australia, Asia, Europe, North Africa and North America.
