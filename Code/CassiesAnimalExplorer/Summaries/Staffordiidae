Staffordiidae is a family of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Trochomorphoidea. Staffordiidae is the only family in the superamily Staffordioidea. This family has no subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Staffordiidae is a poorly understood family, because it occurs only in the Dafla Hills area of India. The fauna and flora of that area has not been researched sufficiently.Various sources consider the family Staffordiidae as part of Dyakiidae or Ariophantidae/Dyakiinae.
