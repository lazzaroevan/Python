Long-footed potoroo – Potorous longipes – is a small marsupial found in southeastern Australia, restricted to an area around the coastal border between New South Wales and Victoria. It was first recorded in 1967 when an adult male was caught in a dog trap in the forest southwest of Bonang, Victoria. It is classified as vulnerable.Potorous longipes is the largest species of Potorous, resembling  the long-nosed Potorous tridactylus. It is a solitary nocturnal creature, feeding on fungi, vegetation and small invertebrates. It differs from the P. tridactylus in its larger feet and longer tail.Current threats to the species include predation by introduced feral cats and foxes, as well as logging within its limited range.
