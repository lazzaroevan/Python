Archiearis infans, the infant, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Heinrich Benno Möschler in 1862. It is found from Alaska to Newfoundland and the northern United States, south in the east to New Jersey, south in the west to California.

The wingspan is 30–33 millimetres (1.2–1.3 in). Adults have mottled brown forewings with a prominent white antemedian and postmedian patch at the costal margin. The hindwings are bright rust orange with variably developed black median and marginal bands. Both sexes are similar. Adults are on wing from late March to early May in one generation per year.
The larva feed on the leaves of birch, alder, poplar, and willow, although larvae that hatch before leaves are available may feed on flower catkins. The species overwinters as a pupa.
