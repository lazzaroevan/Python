The forewings are narrow, whitish and dusted with cinereous speckles, especially along the costa. There is a brown triangular costal patch, followed by a pale space. A brown line runs along the base of the white fringes and a very slender whitish line runs parallel to the apical margin, terminating in a white dash on the costa. The hindwings are pale cinereous.
