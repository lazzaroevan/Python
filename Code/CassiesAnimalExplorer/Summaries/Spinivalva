Spinivalva is a genus of moths in the family Gracillariidae. It contains only one species, Spinivalva gaucha, which is found in Brazil.
The length of the forewings is 2.78â€“3.61 mm. The forewings are mostly covered by dark-grey scales. There is a narrow stripe of white scales along the posterior margin. A zigzag edge, formed by short, oblique white fascia, separates this stripe from the remaining, mostly dark-grey area. The hindwings are completely covered by dark-grey scales.
The larvae feed on Passiflora actinia, Passiflora misera and Passiflora suberosa. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow, slightly serpentine gallery, increasing in width progressively and becoming a blotch during the last larval instar. The larva feeds on the palisade parenchyma. Dark-green granular frass pellets are deposited throughout the mine. The larva leaves the mine through a slit made in the blotch section. Pupation takes place in a cocoon, usually made on the adaxial leaf surface of adjacent leaves.
