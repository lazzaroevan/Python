Pseudophilautus stellatus, also known as starry shrub frog or Kelaart's starry shrub frog, is a frog species in the family Rhacophoridae. It is endemic to Sri Lanka. It was thought to be extinct for 156 years until it was rediscovered in 2009 from the Peak Wilderness, Central Hills of Sri Lanka. This species was previously only known by the lost holotype which was described by Edward Frederick Kelaart in 1853. In 2013, a neotype was designated.
