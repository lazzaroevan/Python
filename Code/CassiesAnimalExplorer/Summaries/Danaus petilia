Danaus petilia, the lesser wanderer,  is a species of butterfly in the nymphalid Danainae subfamily. It is a migratory species which is found in Australia and in tropical countries. Previously considered a subspecies of Danaus chrysippus, this species came about through allopatric speciation. The deep sea barrier called Lydekker's Line, located by the Molluccas and the Sahul Shelf, was what separated Danaus petilia from Danaus chrysippus cratippus. Its caterpillars feed on native and introduced cotton bush species.
