Promops davisoni is a species of free-tailed bat in the family Molossidae. It was first described by Oldfield Thomas in 1921. While once thought of as a subspecies of the big crested mastiff bat (Promops centralis), morphological and geographical differences between P. davisoni and P. centralis are sufficiently suggestive of another species. P. davisoni is native to the Andes mountain range in Ecuador and Peru.
