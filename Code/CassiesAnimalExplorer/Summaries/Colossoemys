Colossoemys is the nomen dubium of an extinct genus of alligatoroid crocodilian. Based on fossils found in the Solim√µes Formation, the finds were assigned to Emys macrococcygeanus, a turtle that would have inhabited the Amazon Basin South America during the Pleistocene epoch. The genus was originally named on the basis of two large procoelous vertebrae, a pubis, and a plastral fragment (likely to be from a turtle rather than a crocodilian). The paucity of material associated with the genus has led Colossoemys to be considered a nomen dubium.
