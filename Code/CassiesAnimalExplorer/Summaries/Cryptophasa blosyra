The wingspan is 43â€“44 mm. The forewings are grey-whitish with a few fuscous and blackish scales. These form a dark streak along the fold not reaching the tornus, and a median streak from one-fifth to four-fifths. There is an ochreous grey annular mark at three-fifths interrupting the median streak. There is an ochreous grey submarginal line feebly barred with blackish. The hindwings are pale fuscous, whitish on the costa.
