The sea toads and coffinfishes are a family of deep-sea anglerfishes known as the Chaunacidae.These are bottom-dwelling fishes found on the continental slopes of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, at depths to at least 2,460 m (8,070 ft). There have also been findings of deep-sea anglerfishes off the coasts of Australia and New Caledonia. Other findings suggest some genera of Chaunacidae are found near volcanic slopes encrusted with manganese. Of the two genera in the family, Chaunacops typically occurs at deeper depths than Chaunax, but with considerable overlap.

They have large, globose bodies and short, compressed tails, and are covered with small, spiny scales. The largest are about 30 cm (12 in) in length. During their gill ventilatory cycle, Chaunacidae are able to take in high volumes of water, increasing their total body volume by 30%. The first dorsal fin ray is modified into a short bioluminescent lure which dangles forward over the mouth, which is turned upwards so as to be nearly vertical. The sensory canals of the lateral lines are especially conspicuous. Chaunax have modified fins which resemble legs. It was also found that they use these modified pelvic fins to assist with maneuvering their swimming, especially when as an escape response.Sea toads are mostly sedentary fish, and rely on a more opportunistic way of hunting where they prey on anything within reach. The sensory canals of the lateral lines are especially conspicuous, and confers advantages in avoidance of predators and consumption of prey.
