Asterophrys is a genus of microhylid frogs found in New Guinea. Their common name is New Guinea bush frogs, although this name may also specifically refer to Asterophrys turpicola.Asterophrys are moderate to large-sized microhylid frogs, with the larger Asterophrys turpicola measuring up to 65 mm (2.6 in) in snout–vent length. A distinctive feature of these frogs is their extremely broad head, almost half of snout–vent length. While both are New Guinean species, A. leucopus is more a mountain species than A. turpicola. The latter is known for its aggressiveness (it may even bite), whereas A. leucopus is more docile.
