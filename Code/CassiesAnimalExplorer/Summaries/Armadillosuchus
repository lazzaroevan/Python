Armadillosuchus is an extinct genus of sphagesaurid crocodylomorph. It was described in February 2009 from the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin in Brazil, dating to approximately 70 Ma. Armadillosuchus length was estimated on 2 metres (6.6 ft) with an estimated body mass of 120 kg (260 lb).Sphagesaurids share a number of mammal-like features in their teeth and jaws, although they are unrelated to mammals. Armadillosuchus is especially mammal-like in that it had heavy body armor characterized by flexible bands and rigid shields that covered its back, less like the traditional osteoderms that line the backs of most crurotarsans and more like that of a modern armadillo (hence the genus name meaning "armadillo crocodile") or a glyptodont. Because of its unique morphology, it is believed to have had a terrestrial and quite possibly fossorial lifestyle.
