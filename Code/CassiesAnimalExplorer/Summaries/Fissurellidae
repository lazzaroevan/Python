Fissurellidae, common name the keyhole limpets and slit limpets, is a taxonomic family of limpet-like sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the clade Vetigastropoda.
Their common name derives from the small hole in the apex of their cone-like shells.  Although superficially resembling "true" limpets, they are in fact not closely related to them.
