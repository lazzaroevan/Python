Dumbea is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is known from the South Province of New Caledonia, and is named after Dumbéa, a town nearby Nouméa. This name was originally used by the French entomologist Charles Adolphe Albert Fauvel to house several species of Eumolpinae from New Caledonia, but Fauvel's Dumbea was unpublished and is a nomen nudum. The genus was established based on general proportions and body size, and may be polyphyletic or paraphyletic.
