The sooty-capped hermit (Phaethornis augusti) is a hummingbird from Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana and Brazil. It builds one of the most remarkable nests which hangs by a single stout cable of spiders' silk from some overhead support.  These curious nests have been found beneath bridges, in highway culverts, and hanging from the roof inside dark buildings. As far as is known, most other hermits build rather similar nests.
The binomial commemorates the French entomologist Auguste Sall√©.
