The snakelocks anemone (Anemonia viridis) is a sea anemone found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The latter population is however sometimes considered a separate species, the Mediterranean snakelocks anemone (Anemonia sulcata).The tentacles are usually a deep green colour with purple tips, the green colour is often attributed to the presence of symbiotic algae within the tentacles but is actually the result of the presence of Green Fluorescent Protein which is present in corals, sea anemones, and some other cnidarians. The anemone tissue contains a symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which is necessary for the long term survival of the sea anemone. When the numbers of algae diminish the anemone may appear dull grey in colour. The algae need light to flourish, so Snakelocks Anemones will be found in the sunniest pools. On average the snakelock anemone is 8 cm wide.
