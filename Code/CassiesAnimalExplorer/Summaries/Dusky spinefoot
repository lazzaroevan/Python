The dusky spinefoot (Siganus luridus) is a species of rabbitfish (Siganidae). It is native to the western Indian Ocean, as well as the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. It has spread to the Mediterranean Sea because of the Suez Canal (Lessepsian migration). It is often found in small schools feeding on benthic algae in shallow water with compacted sand substrates. Its dorsal and anal fin spines contain venom that is not life-threatening to humans.
