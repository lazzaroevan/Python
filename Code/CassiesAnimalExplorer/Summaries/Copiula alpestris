Copiula alpestris is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is endemic to Papua New Guinea and known from the Western Highlands, Chimbu, and Eastern Highlands Provinces at elevations of 1,800–2,800 m (5,900–9,200 ft) above sea level. The specific name is a Latin adjective meaning "living in high mountains", in reference to its relatively high-altitude habitats. Based on molecular evidence, the species was transferred from Oxydactyla to Copiula in 2016.
