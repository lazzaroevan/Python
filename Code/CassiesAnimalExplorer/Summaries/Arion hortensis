Arion hortensis, also known by its common name the "garden slug", "small striped slug" or "black field slug" is a species of small air-breathing land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Arionidae, the roundback slugs.
In Britain, the name Arion hortensis was previously applied to a species complex, consisting of this species plus Arion distinctus Mabille, 1868 and Arion owneii Davies, 1979. Here the name is used sensu stricto.
