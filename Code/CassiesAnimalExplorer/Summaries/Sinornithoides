S. youngi lived during the Early Cretaceous (Aptian/Albian stage, around 113 million years ago). It measured approximately one meter long (3.3 ft). It lived in Inner Mongolia, China, and probably ate invertebrates and other small prey. They lived in what is now Mongolia, which was part of Laurasia.
