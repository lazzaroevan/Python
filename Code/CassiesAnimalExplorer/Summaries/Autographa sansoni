Autographa sansoni, the Alberta beauty, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by F. H. Wolley Dod in 1910. It is found in the western mountains of North America, from Alaska south to Oregon, Idaho and Arizona. Occurring mainly in the Pacific Northwest, it thrives in mid-to-high elevation conifer forest habitat, as well as some areas of coastal rain forest in the Coast range. However, it is also found in a non-contiguous range in sub-alpine forest in the Rocky Mountains, ranging from Alberta in the north, to New Mexico in the south. The wingspan of an adult ranges between 34 and 36 mm. It is widespread, and a relatively common species.
