Copiula pipiens is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is known from its type locality, Wirui near Wewak in the north coast of New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, and from the island of Yapen, off the north-western coast of New Guinea, in the West Papua province of Indonesia. The Yapen population might represent a different but closely related species. Common name Wirui Mehely frog has been coined for this species.
