Archelosauria is a clade grouping turtles and archosaurs (birds and crocodilians) and their fossil relatives. Multiple sequence alignments of DNA and protein sequences and phylogenetic inferences showed that chelonians are the sister group to birds and crocodilians. Morever, there are about 1000 ultra-conserved elements in their genome that are unique to turtles and archosaurs, but which are not found in lepidosaurs (tuatara, lizards and snakes). Other genome-wide analysis also supports this grouping.
