Stenoma crypsangela is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1932. It is found in Peru.The wingspan is 20â€“21 mm. The forewings are pale brownish ochreous, variably more brownish tinged towards the dorsal and terminal areas. In males, there is a subdorsal groove covered by rough scales anteriorly (probably enclosing the hairpencil), the veins partially marked by fine fuscous lines, especially towards the costa posteriorly. There is a small spot of fuscous suffusion on the base of 10 and a similar spot beyond the upper angle of the cell, as well as a dark fuscous dot on the lower angle. There is a marginal series of blackish dots around the posterior third of the costa and termen. The hindwings are grey, paler in females.
