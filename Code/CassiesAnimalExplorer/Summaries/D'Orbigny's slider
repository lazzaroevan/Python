D'Orbigny's slider or the black-bellied slider (Trachemys dorbigni), commonly known in Brazil as tartaruga-tigre or tartaruga-tigre-d'Ã¡gua (which mean "tiger turtle" and "water tiger turtle" in Portuguese), is a species of water turtle in the family Emydidae. The species is found in southern Brazil, northeastern Argentina, and Uruguay. Two subspecies (in addition to the nominate subspecies) are recognized as being valid, Trachemys dorbigni adiutrix and Trachemys dorbigni brasiliensis.
