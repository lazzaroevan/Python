As presently defined, the crested caracara is found in South America, the southern United States, including Florida, where it has been seen on the East coast as far as extreme eastern Seminole County, Florida (Lake Harney), where it is now considered a resident but listed as threatened. There have been reports of the crested caracara as far north as San Francisco, California. and, in 2012, near Crescent City, California. Some are believed to possibly be living in Nova Scotia, with numerous sightings throughout the 2010s. In July 2016 a northern caracara was reported and photographed by numerous people in the upper peninsula of Michigan, just outside of Munising. In June 2017, a northern caracara was sighted far north in St. George, New Brunswick, Canada. A specimen was photographed in Woodstock, Vermont in March 2020. The species has recently become more common in central and north Texas and is generally common in south Texas and south of the US border. It can also be found (nesting) in the Southern Caribbean (e.g. Aruba, Cura√ßao and Bonaire), Mexico, and Central America. It was formerly placed in the genus Polyborus.
