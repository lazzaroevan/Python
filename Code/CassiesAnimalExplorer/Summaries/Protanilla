Protanilla is a genus of subterranean ants in the subfamily Leptanillinae. Known from the Indomalayan realm, the genus contains about twelve species. The genus was erected by Taylor (1990) for the type species P. rafflesi, described from workers from Peninsular Malaysia. Species in this genus have long and downcurved mandibles with peg-like tooth on the inner margins. Four species are known from China (P. bicolor, P. concolor, P. gengma and P. tibeta), one from Taiwan (P. lini), one from Sri Lanka (P. schoedli) and a couple from India (P. wardi, P. flamma).
