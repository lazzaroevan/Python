Australoheros is a fish genus in the cichlid family. Most are restricted to rivers and streams in southeastern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and northeastern Argentina, but at least one species is also found in lakes and swamps. This genus was erected after a taxonomic revision in 2006. These are relatively small cichlids that typically do not surpass 10–15 centimetres (4–6 in) in length, although A. facetus reaches about 20 cm (8 in).
