Oxyaenidae ("sharp hyenas") is a family of extinct carnivorous eutherian mammals. Traditionally classified in order Creodonta, this group is now classified in its own order Oxyaenodonta within clade Ferae. The group contains four subfamilies comprising fifteen genera. North American oxyaenids were the first to appear during the late Paleocene, while smaller radiations of oxyaenids in Europe and Asia occurred during the Eocene.
