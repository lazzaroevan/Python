Cabrera's vole (Microtus cabrerae) is a species of vole native to Spain and Portugal. It is named for √Ångel Cabrera, a mammalogist then working at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid. It is the only living member of the subgenus Iberomys, although two fossil species are also known, including M. brecciensis, the likely direct ancestor of the living species.
