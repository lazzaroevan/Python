The Seram masked owl (Tyto almae) is an owl species in the family Tytonidae endemic to Seram Island in Indonesia. After being first brought to the attention of the world from a photograph taken during an expedition by Rudi Badil and Sukianto Lusli in the Manusela National Park in Seram in 1987 the holotype was mist-netted on 10 February 2012 and this species was formally described in 2013. The species' epithet commemorates Alma Jønsson, the daughter of Knud Andreas Jønsson, one of the describers of the Seram masked owl.
