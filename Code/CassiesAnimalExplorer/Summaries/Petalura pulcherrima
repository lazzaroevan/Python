It has clear wings and a very long, narrow pterostigma.Petalura pulcherrima is endemic to coastal rainforests and monsoon-forest streams of Cape York in Queensland, Australia.
Like other species of the genus Petalura, its larvae live in burrows beside rainforest streams, with an opening above water level.Petalura pulcherrima appears similar to Petalura ingentissima which is larger still and is also found in coastal north-eastern Queensland.Petalura pulcherrima is rarely seen.
