Macrobrachium vollenhoveni, the African river prawn, is a species of large, commercially important prawn from the family Palaemonidae from West Africa. It is a catadromous species that moves from freshwater to brackish water to spawn returning to freshwater as larvae. Recent research has shown that it could potentially be used as a biological control to reduce the rates of infection people living near rivers where this species occurs with schistosomiasis.
