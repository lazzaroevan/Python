Pseuderotis thamnolopha is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1932. It is found in Costa Rica and Guatemala.The wingspan is about 30 mm. The forewings are pale whitish brownish, irregularly irrorated fuscous except towards the anterior half of the costa, the costal edge brownish ochreous from the base to three-fifths, then to four-fifths with roughly projecting rosy-purplish-grey scales, the rosy-purplish-grey suffusion extending more broadly along the costa nearly to the apex. The stigmata are small, cloudy and dark grey, the plical somewhat beyond the first discal, but all these obscured in the irregular fuscous irroration. There is also a terminal series of small, indistinct cloudy fuscous spots. The hindwings are yellow-grey whitish.
