The small tree finch (Camarhynchus parvulus) is a species of bird in the Darwin's finch group of the tanager family Thraupidae.
It has a grasping beak with curved culmens. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. During the non-breeding season it is known to form large groups with small ground-finches.
It is an endemic species to the Galapagos islands and its conservation status has been listed as “Least Concern”. However, bird counts which have been conducted since 1997 have shown a continuous decline in small tree-finch populations in the Scalesia and agricultural zones of Santa Cruz, where the small tree-finch is most abundant. Small tree-finch counts have remained stable in the transition zone (also quite abundant here) and in the less popular dry and fern zones on Santa Cruz island.  A recent study has found that this species is in particularly impacted by the larvae of the parasitic avian vampire fly, Philornis downsi.
