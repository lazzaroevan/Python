The Galapagos crake or Galapagos rail (Laterallus spilonota) is a small rail endemic to the Galapagos Islands. It resembles its sister species, the black rail of The Americas, from which it diverged 1.2 million years ago. It is threatened by introduced species, such as goats and cats, and is considered vulnerable.
