Pseudosimochromis babaulti is a species of cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika preferring areas with rock-rubble substrates.  It can reach a length of 11 centimetres (4.3 in) TL.  It can also be found in the aquarium trade. The specific name honours the collector of the type, the French explorer, naturalist and conservationist Guy Babault (1888-ca. 1932).
