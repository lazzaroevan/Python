Pseudocorax is an extinct genus of shark with two species. It is known from the Cretaceous of Egypt, parts of Eurasia, and the United States. Its name stands for "false raven", due to the similarity of its teeth to those of Squalicorax ("raven shark"). While originally considered to (along with its relative Galeocorax) be a member of the family Anacoracidae (the family that Squalicorax belongs to), a study in 2012 moved it and Galeocorax into the new family Pseudocoracidae, making it only distantly related to Squalicorax.
