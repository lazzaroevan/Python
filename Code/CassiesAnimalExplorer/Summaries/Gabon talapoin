The Gabon talapoin (Miopithecus ogouensis), also known as the northern talapoin, is a small species of African monkey in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in riparian habitats in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and western Republic of the Congo and far western Democratic Republic of Congo. It may have been introduced to Fernando Poo and the Canary Islands. Unlike the related Angolan talapoin, the Gabon talapoin has flesh-coloured (not blackish) ears and facial skin.
