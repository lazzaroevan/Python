Atelopus planispina is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to the eastern slopes of the Andes of Ecuador. According to the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, it is restricted to the Napo Province, although other sources suggest somewhat wider range. It has not been seen since 1985 and might already be extinct. Common names Planispina's harlequin frog, Napo stubfoot toad, and flat-spined atelopus have been coined for it.
