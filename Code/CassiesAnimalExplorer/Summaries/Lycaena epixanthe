Lycaena epixanthe, the bog copper or cranberry-bog copper, is a North American butterfly in the family Lycaenidae.  Adults like to sip drops of dew clinging to leaves and almost exclusively nectar on their host plant, cranberries.  Because of this, bog coppers will spend their entire lives within the area of a single acid bog.  Even though their flight is weak and close to the ground, bog coppers are hard to catch because of the habitat in which they live.  Also, 85% of the bog coppers life span is spent in the egg. It is listed as a species of special concern in the US state of Connecticut.
