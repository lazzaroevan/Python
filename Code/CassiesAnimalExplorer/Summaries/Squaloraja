Squaloraja polyspondyla is an extinct chimaerid from the Lower Jurassic of Europe.  Fossils of S. polyspondyla have been found in Lower Jurassic-aged marine strata of Lyme Regis, England, and Osteno, Italy.
Individuals of S. polyspondyla are characterized by their flattened, ray-like bodies, enormous, flattened rostra that comprise half of the bodylength, and, in males, a long, horn-like process.
