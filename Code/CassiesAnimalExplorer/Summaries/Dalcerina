Dalcerina tijucana is a moth in the family Dalceridae, and the only species in the genus Dalcerina. It was described by Schaus in 1892. It is found in Panama, eastern Peru, Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The habitat consists of tropical wet, tropical moist, tropical premontane moist, subtropical wet, subtropical moist, subtropical dry, subtropical lower montane moist and warm temperate moist forests.
The length of the forewings is 14–20 mm for males and 20–24 mm for females. The forewings are pale yellow, faintly reddish along the outer and inner margins and lightest along the costal margin. There is an elongate oblique dark fuscous discal mark and smoky suffusion below the discal mark and to the middle of the outer margin. Below this, a crescent-shaped mark extends to the inner margin. The hindwings are yellow-orange. Adults are on wing year-round.
The larvae feed on Citrus sinensis, Eucalyptus saligna and Ouratea species.
