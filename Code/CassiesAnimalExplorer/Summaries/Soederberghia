Soederberghia is a genus of prehistoric lungfish that lived during the late Devonian period.
Soederberghia probably had a widespread range because fossils have been discovered in North America, Greenland and Australia.
The long-snouted Soederberghia shares many relationships with the lungfish Rhynchodipterus.
