Sphaerularia vespae is an endoparasitic nematode that infects the Japanese yellow hornet, Vespa simillima. It invades and resides in the gaster (abdomen) of female hornets where it grows and develops. Because S. vespae sterilizes its host, it is also known as a parasitic castrator. After S. bombi, it is the second recognized species of the genus Sphaerularia.
