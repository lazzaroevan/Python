Daniel's tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus danieli)  is a species of rodent in the family Nesomyidae. It was discovered in 2003 in the Parc National de lâ€™Isalo in south-central Madagascar. It is named for Daniel Rakotondravony, professor of animal biology at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar.Daniel's tufted-tailed rat first became known in 1995, when a specimen was found to belong to the majori-penicillatus complex. Molecular data suggested that Major's tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus majori) was a close relative; study of two more animals found in 2002 indicated that the two are different species.
