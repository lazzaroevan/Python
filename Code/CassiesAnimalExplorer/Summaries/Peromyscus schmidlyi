Schmidly's deer mouse (Peromyscus schmidlyi), is a recently described species of deer mouse from the mountains of western Mexico. It is part of the highly complex and well-studied Peromyscus boylii species complex.  The uniqueness of Peromyscus from this area had long been suspected, but was only formalized in 2004 with the publication of its species description.  The species was named in honor of David J. Schmidly, a mammalogist and former president of the University of New Mexico.
The name "Schmidly's deer mouse" is ambiguous, as it is shared by another species, Habromys schmidlyi.
