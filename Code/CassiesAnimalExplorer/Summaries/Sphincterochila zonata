Sphincterochila zonata is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Sphincterochilidae.It inhabits the Negev desert in Israel. It has been described as a synonym for a sister species, S. boissieri, based on initial discoveries of the species by Bourguignat in 1853, though this is not entirely clear throughout current literature.
