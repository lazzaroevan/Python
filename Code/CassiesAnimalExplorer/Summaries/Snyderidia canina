Snyderidia canina is a species of pearlfish found in all tropical waters but those of the eastern Pacific Ocean, depths from 110 to 1,762 m (361 to 5,781 ft). This species grows to a length of 26.8 cm (10.6 in).  This fish is the only known species in its genus which was named in honour of the ichthyologist John Otterbein Snyder (1867-1943) for the assistance he lent to Charles Henry Gilbert on the cruise to Hawaii on which the type specimen was collected.
