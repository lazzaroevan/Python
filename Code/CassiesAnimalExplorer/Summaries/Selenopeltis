Selenopeltis (/sɛliːnoʊpɛltɪs/) is an extinct genus of odontopleurid trilobites in the family Odontopleuridae.
Species in the genus Selenopeltis can reach a length of 115–160 millimetres (4.5–6.3 in) and a width of 115–130 millimetres (4.5–5.1 in). These trilobites show long pleural spines and were a low-level epifaunal detritivore. They lived in the Ordovician period, from the Lower Arenig stage age until the Ashgillian age (478.6-443.7 million years ago).
