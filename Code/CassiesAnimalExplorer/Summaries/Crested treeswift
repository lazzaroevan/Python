The crested treeswift (Hemiprocne coronata) is a kind of tree swift. It was for some time considered the same species as its eastern relative, the grey-rumped treeswift (Hemiprocne longipennis), but they do not interbreed where their ranges overlap. It is distinct in flight, with long, bowed wings and a deeply forked tail that usually appears narrow and pointed.
