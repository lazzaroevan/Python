The pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), occasionally known as the ai (), is a species of three-toed sloth that inhabits tropical rainforests in northern South America.
It is similar in appearance to, and often confused with, the brown-throated sloth, which has a much wider distribution. Genetic evidence has been interpreted to suggest the two species diverged only around 400,000 years ago, although the most recent evidence indicates the split was closer to 6 million years.
