Sespia ("of Sespe Creek") is an extinct genus of oreodont endemic to North America. They lived during the Late Oligocene  26.3â€”24.8 mya, existing for approximately 1.5 million years. Sespia was cat to goat-sized and desert-dwelling. The genus was closely related to the larger Leptauchenia.

 
Fossils of the best known species, the cat-sized S. californica, have been found California and are known from literally thousands of specimens.  The largest species, the goat-sized S. ultima, is known from late Oligocene deposits in Nebraska. S. ultima was once placed in a separate, monotypic, genus as Megasespia middleswarti.  Other species were once placed within Leptauchenia.
