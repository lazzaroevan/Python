Phrynopus montium is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to Peru and only known from two localities near Cascas in the Junín Region: "Cascas near Huasahuasi", the imprecisely known type locality where the types were collected in 1936, and south of Hacienda Cascas, where it was found in 2014. Records from the PascoPasco and Huánuco Regions refer to Phrynopus kotosh and Phrynopus oblivius, respectively. Common name Cascas Andes frog has been coined for this species.
