Finella is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Scaliolidae.This genus has been assigned in the course of time to different families by different authors: Rissoidae, Cerithiidae, Dialidae, Obtortionidae, Finellidae and Diastomatidae Morphological and anatomical studies by Winston Ponder in 1994 established that the genera Finella and Scaliola didn't belong in the above-mentioned families and he brought them in a new family Scaliolidae. This was supported in 1982 by Healy through the study of the ultrastructure on the spermatozoa.
