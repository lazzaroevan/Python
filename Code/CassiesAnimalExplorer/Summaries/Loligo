Loligo is a genus of squid and one of the most representative and widely distributed groups of myopsid squid.
The genus was first described by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1798. However, the name had been used earlier than Lamarck (Schneider, 1784; Linnaeus, 1758) and might even have been used by Pliny. In the early 19th century, this generic name was often used as a grouping for all true squid.
All three species of Loligo are extensively exploited by commercial fisheries. Loligo vulgaris and others are noted for being attracted to night light; they are therefore fished using different light-attraction methods.
