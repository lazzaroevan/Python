Paratypothorax is an extinct genus of aetosaur, known by one species, Paratypothorax andressi. It was first named in 1985 from specimens collected from the Lower Stubensandstein in Germany and was also noted to be present in the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States in both the Dockum and Chinle Formations, which are latest Carnian and Rhaetian in age, respectively. The genus was described from osteoderms that were initially referred to the phytosaur Belodon kappfi. Material from Paratypothorax has also been reported from the Norian-age Fleming Fjord Formation in Greenland.
 
Paratypothorax possesses paramedian scutes that are wide, strap-like, and have grooves and pits on them forming radial patterns. Like other typothoracisines such as Typothorax, the lateral scutes bear large horns that are posteriorly hooked. The rear of each scute is overlapped by a prominent knob.
