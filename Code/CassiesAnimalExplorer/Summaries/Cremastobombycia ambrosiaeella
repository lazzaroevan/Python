The larvae feed on Ambrosia species (including Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Ambrosia trifida), Helianthus species (including Helianthus giganteus), Heterotera squarrosa, Ridania alternifolia and Verbesina species (including Verbesina alternifolia). They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a tentiform mine on the underside of the leaf.
