Formica rufa, also known as the  red wood ant, southern wood ant, or horse ant, is a boreal member of the Formica rufa group of ants, and is the type species for that group. It is native to Europe and Anatolia, but is also found in North America, in both coniferous and broad-leaf broken woodland and parkland. Workers are colored red and brownish-black, with a dorsal dark patch on the head and promensonotum, and are polymorphic, measuring 4.5â€“9 mm in length. They have large mandibles, and like many other ant species, they are able to spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defence. Formic acid was first extracted in 1671 by the English naturalist John Ray by distilling a large number of crushed ants of this species. These ants primarily eat honeydew from aphids. Some groups form large networks of connected nests with multiple queen colonies, while others have single-queen colonies.
