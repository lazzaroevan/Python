The South American snapping turtle (Chelydra acutirostris) is a species of turtle in the family Chelydridae. This species, which is endemic to 
Central and northwestern South America, was previously considered a subspecies of Chelydra serpentina. Its restricted range in South America reflects its recent arrival there as part of the Great American Interchange.
