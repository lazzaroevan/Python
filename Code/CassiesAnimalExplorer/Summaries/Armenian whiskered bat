The Armenian whiskered bat (Myotis hajastanicus), also known as the Hajastan myotis or the Armenian myotis, is a species of bat from the family Vespertilionidae. The Armenian whiskered bat was formerly included as a part of the whiskered bat, but was considered distinct in 2000 as a result of morphologic comparison.
