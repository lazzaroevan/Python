Apolinar's wren (Cistothorus apolinari) is a passerine bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is endemic to the Andean areas of Colombia. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland (between 2500 and 4000 metres altitude), freshwater lakes, and freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss. Its Spanish common name is cucarachero de pantano (literally: swamp cockroach hunter).
This bird is small, (near 13 cm length) with brown head, grey patches around the eyes, streaked dark back and reddish tail.
Its singing is composed mainly of low notes, with a characteristic sound of twii and territorial calls sounding like tchorr.  The bird feeds on spiders and small insects.  Usually it hides in swamps and reed fields with presence of espada√±a plants (Typhaceae) and juncales (Scirpus californicus). The nesting seasons are in March and August.
The common name and scientific name commemorate the Colombian monk Brother Apolinar Maria (1877-1949) who was also an ornithologist.
