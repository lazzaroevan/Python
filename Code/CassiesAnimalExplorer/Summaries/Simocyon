Simocyon (“short-snouted dog”) is a genus of extinct carnivoran mammal in the family Ailuridae.  Simocyon, which was about the size of a mountain lion, lived in the late Miocene and early Pliocene epochs, and has been found in Europe, Asia, and rarely, North America (Peigné et al., 2005) and Africa.
