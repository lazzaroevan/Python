Paratoceras is an extinct genus of Artiodactyla, of the family Protoceratidae, endemic to North America. They lived during the Early to Middle Miocene, 20.4â€”10.3 Ma, existing for approximately 10 million years. Paratoceras resembled deer, but were more closely related to camels. In addition to having horns on the top of the head, they had a third horn on the snout.
