Coninae, or as it is more recently (February 2015) represented as a family, Conidae, common names the cone snails, cone shells or cones, is a taxonomic group of small to large predatory sea snails with cone-shaped shells, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Conoidea.
These are sophisticated predatory animals. They hunt and immobilize prey using a modified radular tooth and a venom gland containing neurotoxins; the tooth is launched out of the snail's mouth in a harpoon-like action. With the harpoon being released in less than 250 milliseconds, it is invisible to the human eye.
The traditional taxonomy of cone snails, which prevailed for over 100 years, placed all of the species in the  genus Conus within the family Conidae. In 2009, a proposed taxonomy  by Tucker & Tenorio grouped the cone snails within five families and 115 genera. In 2014, a paper was released (Puillandre, Duda, Meyer, Olivera & Bouchet) that revised the group again, this time in a much simpler way.
