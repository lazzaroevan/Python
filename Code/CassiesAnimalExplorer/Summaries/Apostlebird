The apostlebird (Struthidea cinerea), also known as the grey jumper, lousy jack,”awky sqwarky” or caw bird is a quick-moving, gray or black bird about 33 cm (13 in) long. It is a native to Australia where it roams woodlands, eating insects and seeds at, or near, ground level. Apostlebirds often travel in groups of about 12; for this reason they were named after the Biblical apostles,  the twelve chief followers of Jesus Christ.
