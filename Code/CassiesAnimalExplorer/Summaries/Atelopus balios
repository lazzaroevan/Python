Atelopus balios, the Rio Pescado stubfoot toad,  is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to southwestern Ecuador, with records from Pacific lowlands in Azuay, Ca√±ar, and Guayas Provinces. It is a rare species that was already suspected to be extinct, but a single specimen was discovered in 2011 by a team from Conservation International during a hunt for missing amphibians.  The decline in amphibian populations is well documented.  The Atelopus balios is Critically Endangered as a result of the widespread amphibian Chytridiomycosis fungus that has decimated other amphibian populations. There are only 10 known findings of the tadpole, Atelopus balios.
