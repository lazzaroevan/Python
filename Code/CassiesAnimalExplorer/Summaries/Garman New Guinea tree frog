The Garman New Guinea tree frog ("Litoria" jeudii) is a species of frog in the family Pelodryadidae.
This species is endemic to Papua New Guinea, and the type is the only known specimen.The specific epithet honors the Dutch zoologist Theodoor Gerard van Lidth de Jeude. The vernacular name is almost certainly a meaningless error, for "German New Guinea tree frog".
