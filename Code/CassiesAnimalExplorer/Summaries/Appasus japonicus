Appasus japonicus is a species of giant water bug in the family Belostomatidae. It is found in Japan and Korea, and has been much studied because it provides an example, rare among insects, of paternal care of the young. With the destruction of its typical habitat and its poor dispersal abilities, it has been listed as being an endangered species in Japan.
