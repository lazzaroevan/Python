The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.
The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.
