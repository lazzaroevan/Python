The antennae are dark fuscous and the thorax is dark fuscous. The abdomen is also dark fuscous, but the segmental margins are partially white. The dark bronzy-fuscous forewings are suboblong, the costa moderately arched anteriorly, the apex obtuse, the termen slightly rounded and somewhat oblique. There are five very undefined irregular transverse shades of white irroration, the first three are rather curved or bent, the fourth forms a clear white spot on the costa beyond the middle and then a fine silvery quadrangular loop passing behind a transverse linear discal mark of white irroration. The fifth is straight and interrupted above the middle. There are also two or three silvery-metallic scales before the termen above the middle. The hindwings are light fuscous, becoming darker towards the termen.
