Arctops ("Bear face") is an extinct genus of gorgonopsian therapsids known from the Late Permian of South Africa. It measured up to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in length and its skull was 30 centimetres (12 in) long. The type species is Arctops willistoni. A second species, A. watsoni, may be synonymous with A. willistoni. A. kitchingi may be a third species of Arctops, but it was only tentatively assigned to the genus when it was first named. Both were formally synonymized with A. willistoni by Christian Kammerer in 2017.
