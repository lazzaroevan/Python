Fumibotys is a monotypic moth genus of the family Crambidae which was described by Eugene G. Munroe in 1976. Its single species, Fumibotys fumalis, the mint root borer moth, described by Achille Guenée in 1854, is found in most of North America.The wingspan is about 20 millimetres (0.79 in). The forewings are orangish to light brown with a large dark patch near the middle of the wing. Adults are on wing from June to August.
Young larvae feed on the leaves of Mentha species, while older larvae feed on the roots and rhizomes of their host plant. Young larvae are 2–3 millimetres (0.079–0.118 in) long. They are yellow to light green with dark stripes. Older larvae reach a length of 19 millimetres (0.75 in). They have a yellow-tan body and a red-brown head. The species overwinters in the prepupal stage in the soil around the roots of their host. Pupation takes place in spring.
