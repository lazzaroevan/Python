The surface is slightly uneven and densely covered with hairs of the plant. There are barely discernible longitudinal stripes. The valve is three-sided and the length of the case is 4-4.5 mm. It is grayish-white in color. Larvae of the first generation can be found in May. There is also a second generation, which feeds on the fruits of the host plant.
