Protomarctus is an extinct monospecific genus of  the Borophaginae subfamily of canids native to North America. They lived during the Middle Miocene 16.0â€”13.6 Mya, existing for approximately 2.4 million years. It was an intermediate-size canid, and more predaceous than earlier borophagines.The first specimen was found in Thomson Quarry, Sheep Creek Formation, Nebraska in a Hemingfordian layer. Specimens have since been found in present-day Colorado, as far west as California and as far southwest as New Mexico. They were short-faced, heavy-jawed canines.
