The sombre hummingbird (Eupetomena cirrochloris) is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae.
It is endemic to Brazil.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and heavily degraded former forest.
This hummingbird was formerly placed in the genus Aphantochroa but based primarily on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014, Aphantochroa has been merged into Eupetomena.
