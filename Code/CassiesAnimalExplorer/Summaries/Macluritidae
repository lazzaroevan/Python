Macluritidae is an extinct family of relatively large, Lower Ordovician to Devonian, macluritacean gastropods(?), hypserstrophically coiled, that is dextral while appearing sinsitral, of which the genus Maclurites is arch-typical.  The base of their shells is flat or gently protruding while the upper side is generally concave.
