Shuleichthys brachypteryx is an extinct species of ray-finned fish which existed in China during the Cretaceous period. Fossils of the fish were found in the Aptian Xiagou Formation of the Changma Basin. It is the only species in the genus Shuleichthys and cannot be placed in any order of the Osteoglossomorpha without making that order paraphyletic.
