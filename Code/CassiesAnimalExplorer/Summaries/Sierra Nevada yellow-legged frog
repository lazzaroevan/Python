The Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog or Sierra Nevada Mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae) is a true frog endemic to the Sierra Nevada of California and Nevada in the United States. It was formerly considered Rana muscosa until a 2007 study elevated the more central and northern populations to full species status, restricting R. muscosa to the southern Sierra Nevada and southern California. The frog is listed as an Endangered species for protection under the Federal Endangered Species Act.
