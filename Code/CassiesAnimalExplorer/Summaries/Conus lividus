Conus lividus, common name the livid cone, is a species of sophisticated predatory sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.
Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
