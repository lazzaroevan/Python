Deinacrida parva is a species of insect in the family Anostostomatidae, the king crickets and weta. It is known commonly as the Kaikoura wētā or Kaikoura giant wētā. It was first described in 1894 from a male individual then rediscovered in 1966 by Dr J.C. Watt at Lake Sedgemore in Upper Wairau.  It is endemic to New Zealand, where it can be found in the northern half of the South Island.This is a small to medium-sized robust wētā. It is easily confused with Deinacrida rugosa. Due to the rarity of this weta, there is still much to be learnt.
