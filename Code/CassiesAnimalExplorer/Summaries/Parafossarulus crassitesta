Parafossarulus crassitesta is an extinct species of freshwater snail with gills and an operculum, an aquatic prosobranch gastropod mollusk in the family Bithyniidae.
Gl√∂er (2002) reassigned two European extinct species of Parafossarulus as a subgenus of the genus Bithynia, but genus Parafossarulus is generally accepted for Asian species.
