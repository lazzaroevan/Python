Fibuloides trapezoidea is a moth of the family Tortricidae. It is known from Guizhou in China.
It is similar to Fibuloides cyanopsis in the shape of uncus and socius, but can be distinguished by the trapezioidal cucullus and the absence of the enlarged, flattened bristles on the neck of valva. In F. cyanopsis the cucullus is ovate and the neck of valva has two or more short enlarged, flattened bristles on its ventral side.
