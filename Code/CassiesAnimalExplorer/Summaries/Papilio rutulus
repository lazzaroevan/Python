Papilio rutulus, the western tiger swallowtail, is a swallowtail butterfly belonging to the Papilionidae family. It is a member of the genus Papilio, of which Papilio appalachiensis and Papilio xuthus are also members. The species was first described by Hippolyte Lucas in 1852.
Like the other tiger swallowtails, the western tiger swallowtail was formerly classified in genus Pterourus, but modern classifications all agree in placing them within Papilio.
