Parafomoria pseudocistivora is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is probably found in the whole Mediterranean region.
The length of the forewings is 2.1-2.6 mm for males and 2.1-2.6 mm for females. Adults are on wing from September to October. There is probably one generation per year.
The larvae feed on Cistus albidus, Cistus crispus, Cistus incanus creticus and Cistus salviifolius. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long, often contorted, narrow corridor that hardly widens towards the end. The frass is deposited in an interrupted central line that never occupies over one third of the corridor width. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.
