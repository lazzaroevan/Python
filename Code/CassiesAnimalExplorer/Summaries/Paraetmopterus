Paraetmopterus is an extinct genus of sharks in the family Etmopteridae. It was described by Adnet in 2006, and the type species is P. nolfi, which existed during the middle Eocene of France. A new species, P. horvathi, which existed in what is now Slovakia during the Miocene epoch, was described by Charlie J. Underwood and Jan Schl√∂gl in 2013; however, this species was subsequently transferred to the separate genus Palaeocentroscymnus.
