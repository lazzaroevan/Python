Piceoerpeton is an extinct genus of prehistoric amphibian, containing species known from the latest Cretaceous (late Maastrichtian), Paleocene and Eocene of North America. It is one of the largest known salamanders, and would have approached the cryptobranchid Andrias in size.  However, Piceoerpeton is unrelated to the Cryptobranchidae; instead it appears to be a member of the extinct family Scapherpetontidae.
