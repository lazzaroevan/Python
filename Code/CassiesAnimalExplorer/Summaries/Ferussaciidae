Ferussaciidae is a family of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Achatinoidea. This family has no subfamilies. The family name Ferussaciidae is from 1883 and therefore it is more recent than the family name Cecilioididae MÃ¶rch, 1864, however the latter has been declared as a  nomen oblitum because it has not been used for over 100 years. Ferussaciidae has been declared a nomen protectum.
