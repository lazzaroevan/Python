The false scorpionfish (Centrogenys vaigiensis), also known as prettyfins, is a species of perciform fish, the only species in genus Centrogenys, which in turn is the only genus in the family Centrogenyidae. They are pale grey or brown and usually grow no longer than 25 cm (9.8 in). False scorpionfish are distributed throughout the Indo-West Pacific, bounded by the Ryukyu Islands of Japan to the north and Australia to the south, the Nicobar Islands to the west and New Guinea to the east.
