Aspidogaster conchicola is a trematode parasite of the Aspidogastrea subclass that commonly infects freshwater clams. It has not been well studied since it is of little economic or medical importance, but A. conchicola and its fellow aspidogastreans are of significant biological importance since they may represent a step between free-living and parasitic organisms.
