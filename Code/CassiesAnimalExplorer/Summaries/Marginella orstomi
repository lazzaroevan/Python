Marginella orstomi is a species of colorful small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Marginellidae.
The marine malacofauna of West Africa is rich in Marginellidae. The holotype of Marginella orstomi was collected at a depth of between 200 and 250 m, off Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo. (A related species was dredged from a more northern locality off the coast of Congo.) The species is also related to Marginella huberti Clover, 1972, from Lobito, Angola.
