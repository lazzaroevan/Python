Patera clarki nantahala, the noonday globe, is a subspecies of Patera clarki, a land snail in the family Polygyridae. It is endemic to North Carolina in the United States.
The name nantahala is a Cherokee word which means noonday. This subspecies was given this name because the snail lives in a deep gorge where the sunshine does not reach the ground until the middle of the day.
