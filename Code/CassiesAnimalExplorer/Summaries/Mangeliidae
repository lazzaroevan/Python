Mangeliidae  is a monophyletic family of small to medium-sized, predatory sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Conoidea.
Prior to 2011, both the subfamilies Mangeliinae and Oenopotinae had been placed in the family Conidae. In 2011, Bouchet, Kantor et al merged the two subfamilies into one taxon, which they elevated to the rank of family. This was based on anatomical characters and a dataset of molecular sequences of three gene fragments.Mangeliidae is a sister-clade to the family Raphitomidae As with their relatives in the family Conidae, species in the family Mangelidae use potent venoms to catch their prey. Through this characteristic, they are of interest in pharmacological research.
