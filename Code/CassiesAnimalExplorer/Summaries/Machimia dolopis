Machimia dolopis is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Walsingham in 1912. It is found in Mexico (Guerrero).The wingspan is 15â€“17 mm. The forewings are smoky white, with minute fuscous dusting on a white ground colour. There is a narrow fuscous costal line at the base of the wing and a smoky fuscous discal spot at one-third, with a spot in the fold below and beyond it, which is followed by a larger ill-defined spot at the end of the cell. Straight below this is another plical spot, diffused downward to the dorsum and forming the lower extremity of a series of smoky fuscous spots, which, running parallel with the termen, form an angle pointing to the apex and revert to the costa at about two-thirds. The hindwings are shining whitish cinereous.
