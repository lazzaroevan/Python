Stenus is a genus of semiaquatic rove beetles in the subfamily Steninae, and likely the largest genus in the kingdom Animalia, with some 3000 known species worldwide (only the beetle genus Agrilus is comparable in size). They are known for swimming by emitting pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension and allow them to move on the surface of water.
