Lynchius simmonsi (common name: Simmons' big-headed frog) is a frog species in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to southern Ecuador where it is known from the type locality in the Cordillera del CÃ³ndor, Morona-Santiago Province as well as from the adjacent Zamora-Chinchipe Province. Its natural habitat is subtropical old-growth forest. The type series was collected by day on the forest floor. The area was mined during the Cenepa War in 1995, and has consequently seen little human activity, although this may change through a proposed road.
