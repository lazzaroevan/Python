Coxoplectoptera or "chimera wings" is an extinct order of winged insects containing one family, Mickoleitiidae.  Coxoplectopterans are closely related to the mayflies.
Two adult and more than 20 nymphal fossils of Mickoleitia have been scientifically described from Mesozoic outcrops, mainly from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil (in total, around 40 fossil nymphs have been found). Coxoplectoptera belong to the stem group of mayflies. Both the winged adults and the aquatic nymphs were predators with raptorial forelegs, which are reminiscent to those of praying mantids. The nymphs had a peculiar freshwater shrimp-like habitus.
