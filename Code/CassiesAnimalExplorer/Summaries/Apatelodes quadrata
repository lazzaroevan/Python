The forewings are grey, finely sprinkled with light brown. There is a double antemedial line only visible at the inner margin and costa, preceded by a white line and a large dark violaceous-brown spot on the inner margin. There is a brown postmedial line excurved beyond the cell, a brown fascia from the antemedial on the costa to the postmedial, as well as a dark violaceous-brown subapical spot, followed by minute semi hyaline spots and a larger semihyaline (almost glass-like) spot.

The terminal area is fuscous grey.
