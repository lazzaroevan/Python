Arcitalitrus sylvaticus, known generally as the lawn shrimp or landhopper, is a species of beach hopper in the family Talitridae. It is found in Australia and nearby areas of the Pacific but has been introduced to other places, like California, New Zealand, the British Isles, and Florida.They die in dry conditions and drown if it's too wet. In California, especially, they are a sign of overwatering as they will leave their homes to avoid drowning.
