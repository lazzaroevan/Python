Cyclophora ruficiliaria, the Jersey mocha, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Sch√§ffer in 1855. It can be found in Europe, in particular the Channel Islands as well as other parts of the mainland United Kingdom.
The first ever recorded sighting of the Jersey mocha on the British mainland was in July 2003 at Isle of Portland, Dorset. Subsequently, the butterfly has been found again in Dorset, and has set up a small breeding colony in south-west Cornwall. The first recorded sighting of the moth in Hertfordshire occurred in September 2016, on Roughdown Common.
