Furca (Latin for "fork") is an extinct genus of marrellomorph arthropod known from the Sandbian stage (upper Ordovician period) of the Czech Republic. At least three distinct species have been described although they may all be synonyms of the type species, Furca bohemica. A tentative additional species, "Furca mauretanica": was proposed for specimens discovered in Morocco, but this species remains a nomen nudum until formally published.
