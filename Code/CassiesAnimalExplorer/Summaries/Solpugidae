Solpugidae is a family of solifuges or sun spiders.
Solpugidae have groups of papillae on their pedipalps or sensory organs. The papillae come out of sockets that are characterized with the function of mechanoreceptor, and contact chemoreceptors, which allows them to respond to stimuli such as touch and sound.
