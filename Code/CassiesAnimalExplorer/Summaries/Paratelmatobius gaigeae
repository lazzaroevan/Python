Paratelmatobius gaigeae is named after Helen Beulah Thompson Gaige, an American herpetologist.Its natural habitats are montane forests. It is a terrestrial frog that probably breeds in temporary ponds or streams. It is threatened by habitat loss; logging might have already caused extirpation of this species from its type locality, Bonito in the Serra da Bocaina.
