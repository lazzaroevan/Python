Loxosceles adelaida is a species of venomous recluse spider found in South America.
L. adelaida inhabits mainly in caves, but has also been reported in forests adjacent to caves in Brazil. A recent study on the biological activity of venom of this species proved that it has a similar potential to induce hemolysis, dermonecrosis and lethality that L. gaucho, its venom produced a component of 31 kDa, endowed with hemolytic and dermonecrotic activities, therefore it has the potential to cause serious accidents as well as synanthropic species.
