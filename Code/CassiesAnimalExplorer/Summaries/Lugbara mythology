The Lugbara live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda , and South Sudan. In Lugbara mythology, Adroa appeared in both good and evil aspects; he was the creator god and appeared on Earth as a man who was near death.  He was depicted as a very tall white man with only one half of a body, missing one eye, one leg, etc.  His children were called the Adroanzi.
The Adroanzi were nature gods of specific rivers, trees and other sacred wild areas.  At night, they followed people and protected them from animals and bandits as long as they did not look over their shoulder to ensure that an Adroanzi was following; if the person did so, the Adroanzi killed them. The people they killed, they ate. They were also sometimes known as water snakes. Some Africans consider them gardeners.
