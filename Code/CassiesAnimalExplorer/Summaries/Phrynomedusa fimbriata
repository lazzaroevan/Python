Phrynomedusa fimbriata, the spiny-knee leaf frog, is a presumably extinct species of tree frog. It was endemic to Brazil, where the only known specimen was discovered near Paranapiacaba in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. The type locality was given as "Alto da Serra". While the species might still exist, having only been found once in the 1898, no trace of any individuals have been discovered in successive expeditions.
