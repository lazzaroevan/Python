Myiodynastes is a genus of birds in the family Tyrannidae. Created by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857, the genus contains five species which are collectively referred to as "sulphur-bellied flycatchers"; that name is also given to one of the individual species in the genus. The genus name Myiodynastes is a compound word composed from two Greek words: muia, meaning "fly" and dunastáº½s, meaning "ruler".
