The typical spinetails, Cranioleuca, are a genus of Neotropical birds in the ovenbird family Furnariidae.
This is a homogeneous group of small birds that live in forested habitats. The spinetails in this genus differ from those placed in Synallaxis in having shorter tails and being more arboreal. They are less vocal and more frequently join mixed flocks.
