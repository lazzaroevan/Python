Procyclotosaurus is an extinct genus of stenotosaurid capitosaurian temnospondyl. The type species is P. stantonensis. In 1904, English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward described it as a species of Capitosaurus, C. stantonensis, based on a partial skull known as R 3174. In 1958, the species was assigned to the new genus. It is known from the Lower Keuper, a European stratigraphic unit that was deposited during the late Middle Triassic. Fossils have been found from Staffordshire, England.
