Huttonia is a monotypic genus of ecribellate South Pacific araneomorph spiders in the Huttoniidae family containing the single species, Huttonia palpimanoides. Although only one species is described, there are still about twenty more undescribed species.It was first described by Octavius Pickard-Cambridge in 1880, and has only been found in New Zealand. Originally placed with the ant spiders, it was moved to the Huttoniidae in 1984.Fossils of this family have been found from Cretaceous (Campanian) amber in from Alberta and Manitoba, Canada. This extended the known geological age of the Huttoniidae back about 80 million years, supporting the theory of H. palpimanoides being an ousted relict species. They are probably most closely related to the now extinct family, Spatiatoridae.
