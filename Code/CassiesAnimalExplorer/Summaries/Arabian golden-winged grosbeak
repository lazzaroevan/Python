The Arabian golden-winged grosbeak or Arabian grosbeak (Rhynchostruthus percivali) is a finch found in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Yemen. It is included as a subspecies in R. socotranus by some authorities, but in recent times the three golden-winged grosbeak populations are usually considered distinct species.
