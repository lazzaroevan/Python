Phanuromyia odo is a species of wasp, found in the tropical regions of North, South, and Central America. The wasp is known to have inconsistent physical features, which is why the scientists who discovered this species named it after the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine character, Odo, who was popularly known to have shape-shifting abilities.
