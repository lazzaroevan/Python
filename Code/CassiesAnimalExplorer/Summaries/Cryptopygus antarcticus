The Antarctic springtail, Cryptopygus antarcticus, is a species of springtail native to Antarctica  and Australia. Cryptopygus antarcticus average 1–2 millimetres (0.04–0.08 in) long and weigh only a few micrograms. Like other springtails, the Antarctic springtail too has been found to be useful as a bioindicator of pollution and has been used to study microplastic pollution in Antarctica.
