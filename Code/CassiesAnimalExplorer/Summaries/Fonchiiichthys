Fonchiiichthys uracanthus is a species of armored catfish native to Costa Rica and Panama.  This species is the only member of its genus.  However, Fonchiiichthys has recently been considered to be a synonym of Rineloricaria and thus may be invalid.  This species grows to a length of 16.5 centimetres (6.5 in) SL.
