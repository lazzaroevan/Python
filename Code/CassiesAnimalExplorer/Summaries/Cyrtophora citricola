Cyrtophora citricola, also known as the tropical tent-web spider, is an orb-weaver spider in the family Araneidae. It is found in Asia, Africa, Australia, Costa Rica, Hispaniola, Colombia, and Southern Europe. In 2000, it was discovered in Florida.
C. citricola is in the orb web spider family, but its orb webs are considered atypical. Its webs are mesh-like, with a horizontal appearance. The spider has developed distinct and specific prey-capturing techniques using its unconventional webs. The difference in C. citricola's web silk is from physiological changes in its spinning apparatuses.  The spider can be social, and its webs are often built in large matrices next to one another.
C. citricola is nocturnal, only performing necessary tasks during the day. During the day, it remains idle and tries to stay out of sight from predators. Most of its foraging and prey capture happen at night. At times it may also have to ward off other spiders in the colony that may try and claim its web.C. citricola's color can vary greatly. Many spiders sport a black and white pattern while others are brown. Males often appear black. Male and female spiders have a sexual dimorphism. The body length in females normally reaches 10 mm, while males are only 3 mm long.
