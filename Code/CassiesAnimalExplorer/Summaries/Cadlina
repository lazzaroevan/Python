Cadlina is a genus of sea slugs, dorid nudibranchs, shell-less marine gastropod mollusks historically classified in the family Chromodorididae. Recent research by R.F. Johnson in 2011 has shown that Cadlina does not belong to the family Chromodorididae. She has therefore brought back the name Cadlinidae from synonymy with Chromodorididae. The family Cadlinidae also includes the genus Aldisa Bergh, 1878.
