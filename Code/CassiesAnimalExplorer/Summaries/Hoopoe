Hoopoes () are colourful birds found across Africa, Asia, and Europe, notable for their distinctive "crown" of feathers. Three living and one extinct species are recognized, though for many years all of the extant species were lumped as a single speciesâ€”Upupa epops. In fact, some taxonomists still consider all three species conspecific.  Some authorities also keep the African and Eurasian hoopoe together but split the Madagascar hoopoe.
