Selfing or self-fertilization is the union of male and female gametes and/or nuclei from the same haploid, diploid, or polyploid organism. It is an extreme degree of inbreeding.Selfing  is widespread â€“ from unicellular organisms to the most complex hermaphroditic plants and animals (especially invertebrates). In unicellular organisms such as Protozoa, selfing can occur when two individuals (or their cell nuclei) interbreed that were produced from a previous mitotic division of the same individual.  About 10-15% of flowering plants are predominantly selfing.Among hermaphrodite animals there are some that regularly reproduce by self-fertilization. In others, it is a rare event; selfing in such species is more common in adverse environmental conditions, or in the absence of a partner.
