Marsdenichthys is an extinct genus of Devonian tetrapodomorph. Fossils have been found from Mount Howitt in Victoria, Australia from strata that are Givetian-Frasnian in age. Mount Howitt is an important site that has been the source of many tetrapodomorph fossils, including Beelarongia and Howittichthys, both of which were first described from the locality.

Marsdenichthys was first named in 1985 on the basis of material collected from Mount Howitt. The genus was initially described as a member of the family Eusthenopteridae (now known as the Tristichopteridae), the first known from the southern hemisphere. However, the classification of Marsdenichthys within Tetrapodomorpha has often been debated and there is not yet a consensus on the exact phylogenetic relationships of the genus.
