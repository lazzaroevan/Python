Llanocetus (“Llano's whale”) is a genus of extinct toothed baleen whales from the Late Eocene of Antarctica. The type species, Llanocetus denticrinatus, reached gigantic proportions, with the juvenile specimen reaching an estimated 8 m (26 ft) in length; a second, unnamed species, known only from three isolated premolar teeth, reached an estimated total body length of up to 12 m (39 ft). Like contemporary baleen whales, Llanocetus completely lacked baleen in its jaws. It was probably a suction feeder like the modern beaked and pygmy right whales.
