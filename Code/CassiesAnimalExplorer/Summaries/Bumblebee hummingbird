The bumblebee hummingbird (Selasphorus heloisa) is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is predominantly found in Mexico, but has occurred as a vagrant in the United States (Arizona). At 7 to 7.5 cm (2.8 to 3.0 in), it is the smallest bird known to have occurred in North America north of Mexico. At a weight of 2.2 g (0.078 oz), it is one of the smallest birds known to exist in the world. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.
The bumblebee hummingbird is dispersed through both the Pacific and Atlantic inclines (from southern Chihuahua to southern Oaxaca and from southern Tamaulipas to northern Oaxaca, respectively) and within the focal area of the nation along the Transvolcanic belt to Oaxaca.
