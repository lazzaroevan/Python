Pseudohercostomus is a genus of flies in the family Dolichopodidae. It is distributed in the Oriental and Afrotropical realms as well as Chile.
Historically, the genus has generally been placed in the subfamily Dolichopodinae. In 2005, based on a cladistic analysis of the subfamily, Scott E. Brooks excluded Pseudohercostomus from the Dolichopodinae. The systematic position of the genus is still unclear, though a possible relationship with the New World genus Keirosoma has been suggested.
