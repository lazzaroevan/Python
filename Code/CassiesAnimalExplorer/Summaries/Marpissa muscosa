Marpissa muscosa is a species of jumping spider.

On average, females have body length ranging from 7.5–14mm, whereas males have a body length ranging from 6–8.1mm. Both sexes are coloured grey to brown. The whole spider has a furry appearance and is flattened in shape.
The species builds a kind of nest under the bark of dead trees. Up to 100 of these nests can occur side by side. As other species of Marpissa spiders, it demonstrates a social hierarchy: weaker animals will acknowledge their inferiority by strutting their front legs and slowly retreating from the scene. Early environmental conditions shape personality types in the developing spiders.
