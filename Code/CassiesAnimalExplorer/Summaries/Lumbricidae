The Lumbricidae are a family of earthworms which doesn't include the earthworm species well-known to Europeans.  About 33 lumbricid species have become naturalized around the world, but the bulk of the species are in the Holarctic region: from Canada (e.g. Bimastos lawrenceae on Vancouver Island) and the United States (e.g. Eisenoides carolinensis, Eisenoides lonnbergi and most Bimastos spp.) and throughout Eurasia to Japan (e.g. Eisenia japonica, E. koreana and Helodrilus hachiojii).  An enigmatic species in Tasmania is Eophila eti.  Currently, 670 valid species and subspecies in about 42 genera are recognized.
