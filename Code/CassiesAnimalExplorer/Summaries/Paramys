Paramys is an extinct genus of rodents from North America, Europe, and Asia.  It is one of the oldest genera of rodents known and probably lived in trees. While the genus name literally means "like a mouse", it coexisted with Thisbemys, a similar rodent, thus yielding a reference to Pyramus and Thisbe.
