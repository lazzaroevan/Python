Philocryptica is a monotypic genus of moths belonging to the subfamily Tortricinae of the family Tortricidae. It contains only one species, Philocryptica polypodii, the leather-leaf star-miner, which is found in New Zealand, where it has been recorded from both the North Island and the South Island (as far south as Banks Peninsula).The wingspan is about 10 mm. The forewings are light brown, shaded with reddish brown towards the wing tip.
The larvae feed on Pyrrosia eleagnifolia, mining the leaves. Young larvae create a number of mines radiating from the base. Older larvae create a large blotch mine. Full-grown larvae reach a length of 12â€“14 mm.
