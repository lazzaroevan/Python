The Spanish fly (Lytta vesicatoria) is an emerald-green beetle in the blister beetle family (Meloidae). It and other such species were used in preparations offered by traditional apothecaries, often referred to as Cantharides or Spanish fly.  The insect is the source of the terpenoid cantharidin, a toxic blistering agent once used as an aphrodisiac.
L. vesicatoria is sometimes called Cantharis vesicatoria, although the genus Cantharis is in an unrelated family, Cantharidae, the soldier beetles.
