Profundiconus tuberculosus is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Profundiconus tuberculosus was believed to be extinct, and thus it is often represented with a dagger "â€ " as a fossil species.  Mike Filmer (2011) notes in Nomenclature and Taxonomy in Living Conidae that living specimens have been found, citing Toki, 1937.
Like all species within the genus Profundiconus, these cone snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
