The Corbiculidae are a family of clams in the mollusc order Venerida. They are known commonly as basket clams. The family name comes from the root corbus ("basket"), and was inspired by the concentric ribbing of the shells.Clams in this family release many juveniles into the surrounding waters that have hatched inside the clams (ovoviviparous). Fertilization is internal. The juveniles are much smaller than those of the related family Sphaeriidae.
Corbicula fluminea, known commonly as the Asian or Asiatic clam, is an invasive species in many parts of the world.
