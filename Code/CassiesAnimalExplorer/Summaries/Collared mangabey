The collared mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus), also known as the red-capped mangabey, or the white-collared mangabey (leading to easy confusion with Cercocebus atys lunulatus), is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae of Old World monkeys. It formerly included the sooty mangabey as a subspecies. As presently defined, the collared mangabey is monotypic.
