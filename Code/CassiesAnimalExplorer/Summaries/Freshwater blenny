The freshwater blenny ((Salaria fluviatilis) is a species of fish in the family Blenniidae. It is found in African rivers and brooks in Algeria and Morocco flowing to the Mediterranean Sea.  In Europe it is widespread in the freshwaters of Albania, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Spain and Portugal, while in Asia it is in Turkey and Israel.  This species reaches a length of 15 centimetres (5.9 in) TL. This taxon may be paraphyletic as the populations in Turkey and Israel are more genetically divergent from other populations of freshwater blenny than the Trichonis blenny and it has been suggested that the population in Kinneret Lake in Israel has been proposed as a new species.
