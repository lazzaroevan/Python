Ctenophryne carpish is a rare and little-known species of microhylid frogs endemic to Peru. It is known from its type locality on the Cordillera de Carpish, Huánuco, and from near Juanjuí in the San Martín Region. It lacks eardrums, and at a cursory glance it resembles leptodactylid frogs of the genus Phrynopus, in which it was initially placed.
