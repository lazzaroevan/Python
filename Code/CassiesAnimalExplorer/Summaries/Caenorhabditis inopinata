Caenorhabditis inopinata - prior to 2017 referred to as C. sp. 34. - is a sister species to C. elegans (it is classified in the 'Elegans' supergroup).The specific epithet comes from the Latin inopinus (“unexpected”).
This gonochoristic (male-female) species was isolated from figs (Ficus septica) and fig wasps in Ishigaki Island, in Japan. It was recovered by N. Kanzaki in 2013. It is a larger species than C. elegans.
Its genome is being sequenced at the University of Miyazaki.
