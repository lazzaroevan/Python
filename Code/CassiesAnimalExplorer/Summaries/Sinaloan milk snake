Lampropeltis triangulum sinaloae, commonly known as the Sinaloan milk snake, is an egg-laying subspecies of nonvenomous colubrid snake. It is one of the most commonly bred milk snakes in captivity. It is a fairly docile subspecies and will rarely bite. However, if handled, it may discharge a pungent smelling exudate from the cloaca as a warning. The Sinaloan milk snake inhabits the rocky and semi-arid drylands of southwestern Sonora, Sinaloa, and southwestern Chihuahua (Mexico).
