The Senegalese cobra (Naja senegalensis) is a species of cobra in the genus Naja that is found in West Africa. This species was long thought to be identical to the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje), but morphological and genetic differences have led to its recognition as a separate species. It differs from Naja haje in normally having more than 23 dorsal scale rows around the neck and a uniformly dark head without any obvious pattern on the supralabial scales.
