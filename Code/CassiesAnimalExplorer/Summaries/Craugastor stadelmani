Craugastor stadelmani is a rare species of frog in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to the mountains of northern Honduras. The specific name stadelmani honors Raymond Edward Stadelman, curator at the Tela serpentarium and naturalist at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Common names Stadelman's coqui, Stadelman's patterlove, and north-central Honduran montane streamside frog have been coined for it.
