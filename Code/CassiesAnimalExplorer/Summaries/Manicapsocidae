Manicapsocidae is a family of Psocoptera. It contains 8 extant species in 4 genera, with most of the species being found in the Neotropics, with one species in the Afrotropics. The extinct family Electrentomidae has been suggested to be a synonym of this family, though this has been considered premature by other scholars in the absence of cladistic analysis. Confirmed fossil species of the family are nearly as numerous as living ones, extending back to the Mid-Cretaceous.
