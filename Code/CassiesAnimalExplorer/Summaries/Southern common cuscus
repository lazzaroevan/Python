The southern common cuscus (Phalanger mimicus), also known as Australian cuscus, grey cuscus, grey phalanger, and to-ili, is an arboreal marsupial endemic to Australia (Cape York), southern New Guinea and possibly the Aru Islands. Until recently, it was considered conspecific with P. intercastellanus, and before that also with P. orientalis.
