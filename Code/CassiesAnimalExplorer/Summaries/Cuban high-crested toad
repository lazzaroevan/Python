The Cuban high-crested toad (Peltophryne gundlachi), or Gundlach's Caribbean toad, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae that is endemic to Cuba. It is found plains in all provinces as well as Isla de la Juventud and the Sabana-Camag√ºey Archipelago. The specific name gundlachi honors Johannes Christoph Gundlach, a German zoologist. Its natural habitats are primarily forests but also xeric and mesic grasslands. It is an explosive breeder of rain-flooded pools. It is threatened by habitat loss and degradation caused by agriculture, and by agricultural pollution. Its habitat is also threatened by the invasive tree Dichrostachys cinerea.
