The Smallfin worm-eel (Pseudomyrophis micropinna, also known as the Plain worm eel) is an eel in the family Ophichthidae (worm/snake eels). It was described by Charles Barkley Wade in 1946. It is a marine, tropical eel which is known from the eastern central and southeastern Pacific Ocean, including Nicaragua, Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. It dwells at a depth range of 100 to 200 metres (330 to 660 ft), and inhabits sediments of mud. Males can reach a maximum total length of 16 centimetres (6.3 in).Due to its wide distribution, lack of known threats, and lack of observed population decline, the IUCN redlist currently lists the Smallfin worm-eel as Least Concern.
