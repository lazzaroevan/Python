The argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata) is a day-flying moth of the family Geometridae, with distinctive black and white colors. They tend to live on wetlands and hillsides. The larvae spin together the leaves of their food plants (such as birch and bog myrtle) to form their cocoons. It was named argent and sable in 1778. Argent and sable refer to the heraldic color names for white and black. Their distribution is Holarctic. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.
