Stigmella myricafoliella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It has been recorded in North America from Florida and Nova Scotia.

The wingspan is 5-5.2 mm.The larvae feed on Myrica species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine begins on the upper side as a short serpentine track, but soon broadens out in a large irregular blotch, often obliterating the early part of the mine. The frass is black and scattered. When full grown, the larva is 4.5â€“5 mm long, cylindrical and somewhat flattened. The color is white, with light-brown mandibles and two small black lateral spots on the first thoracic segment. Pupation takes place in a hammock outside of the mine on the leaf in a glistening white oblong cocoon spun under an equally showy white bridgework of longitudinal silken bands. One leaf often contains several mines.
