Papurana milneana is a species of "true frog", family Ranidae. It is endemic to Papua New Guinea where it is found in the upland areas of Milne Bay, Morobe, Northern, and Central Provinces, as well from the D'Entrecasteaux Islands and, tentatively, Louisiade Archipelago. It was originally described as a subspecies of Rana grisea (now Papurana grisea), but raised to full-species status in 2007.
