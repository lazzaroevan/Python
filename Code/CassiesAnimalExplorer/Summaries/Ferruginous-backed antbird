The ferruginous-backed antbird (Myrmoderus ferrugineus) is a species of passerine bird in the family Thamnophilidae.
It inhabits the Guyanas and the northern Amazon Basin.
Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
The ferruginous-backed antbird was formerly included in the genus Myrmeciza. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that Myrmeciza, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera four species including the ferruginous-backed antbird were moved to the resurrected genus Myrmoderus.
