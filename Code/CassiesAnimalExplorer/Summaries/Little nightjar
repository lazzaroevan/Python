The little nightjar (Setopagis parvula) is a species of nightjar in the family Caprimulgidae.  It is found in woodland and other semi-open habitats in eastern, central and southern Brazil, eastern Peru, eastern and northern Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina. It is fairly common in most of its range. It has sometimes included the Todd's nightjar (S. heterura) of northern South America as a subspecies. The two are visually very similar, but vocally distinctive.
