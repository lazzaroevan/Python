Humboldt's white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons) is a species of gracile capuchin monkey.  The species name Cebus albifrons was formerly considered to also include several types of white-fronted capuchin monkey which are now regarded as separate species based on genetic studies by Boubli and Lynch Alfaro.
