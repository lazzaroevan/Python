Parthenina is a genus of very small sea snails, pyramidellid gastropod mollusks or micromollusks.This genus is currently placed in the subfamily Chrysallidinae of the family Odostomiidae. The name Parthenia was created by Lowe in 1840 for the species in this group, but had to be replaced since it was preoccupied by a name for a group of dipterans described by Roubineau-Desvoidy in 1830.
