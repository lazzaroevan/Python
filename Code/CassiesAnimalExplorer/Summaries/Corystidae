Corystidae is a family of crabs, in its own superfamily, Corystoidea. It includes what was once thought to be the oldest Eubrachyuran fossil, Hebertides jurassica, thought to be dating from the Bathonian (Middle Jurassic); the species was subsequently reinterpreted as being Cenozoic in age. Corystidae contains ten extant and five extinct species in eight genera:
