Caeciliusidae is a family of Psocoptera belonging to the suborder Psocomorpha. The family was once named Caeciliidae, but the latter name was changed because of homonymy with the amphibian family Caeciliidae. The subfamily Paracaeciliinae was formerly in Caeciliusidae, but it has been elevated to family rank, Paracaeciliidae.
There are at least 40 genera and 650 described species in Caeciliusidae.
