Aristaea pavoniella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is found from Germany and Poland to Italy, as well as central and southern Russia.

The wingspan is 8â€“10 mm.The larvae feed on Aster alpinus, Aster amellus and Aster bellidiastrum. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts with a very shallow lower-surface corridor, continuing as a large full depth tentiform mine. The upper surface shows a distinct keel. Within this keel the larva spins a cocoon, in which it retires during feeding pauses. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.
