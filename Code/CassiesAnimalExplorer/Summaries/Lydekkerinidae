Lydekkerinidae is a family of stereospondyl temnospondyls that lived in the Triassic period. During the Triassic, lydekkerinids had a global distribution. They were small-bodied with wedge-shaped, roughly triangular heads. Fossils have been found in Russia, Greenland, India, South Africa, Madagascar, and Australia. The type genus is Lydekkerina, the namesake of the family and the most well-known lydekkerinid.
