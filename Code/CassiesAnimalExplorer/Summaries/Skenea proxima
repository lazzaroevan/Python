Skenea proxima is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Skeneidae.The name Cyclostrema proxima was introduced by G.W. Tryon as a replacement name for Cyclostrema affine Verrill, 1884 (now recognized as a synonym of Skenea basistriata (Jeffreys, 1877)), while he thought it was closely related to Cyclostrema basistriata Brugnone. Anders War√©n thought it would probably prove a synonym of Skenea diaphana. W.H. Dall thought it a synonym of Skenea trochoides.
