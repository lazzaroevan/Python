The shy albatross,  also known as shy mollymawk, (Thalassarche cauta, formerly Diomedea cauta),  is a medium-sized albatross that breeds on three remote islands off the coast of Tasmania, Australia, in the southern Indian Ocean. Its lifespan is about 60 years, and it has been seen as far afield as South Africa and the Pacific coast of the United States. As of June 2020, the species is listed as "Endangered" in Australia; there are thought to be 15,000 pairs of shy albatross left. It is Australia's only endemic albatross.
Some authorities call this species the white-capped albatross, but the White-capped albatross is generally the common name given to Thalassarche cauta steadi.
