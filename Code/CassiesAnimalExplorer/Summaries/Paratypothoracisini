Paratypothoracisini is a clade of aetosaurs within the subfamily Aetosaurinae. It is a node-based taxon that includes Heliocanthus, Paratypothorax, Tecovasuchus, and all descendants of their most recent common ancestor. All synapomorphies that diagnose the clade can be found in the osteoderms. These include dorsal eminences of the paramedian plates that never or almost never contact the posterior margins of the plates and dorsoventrally flattened "horns" formed from the lateral spikes of the cervical and anterior dorsal regions.
