Mulsantina is a genus of ladybugs (family Coccinellidae), found in North and Central America.
The genus was named by entomologist Julius Weise after Ã‰tienne Mulsant, who in 1846 and 1850 published monographs that were very important to the development of modern coccinellid taxonomy. Mulsant had previously named this genus Cleis, but as this name was found to be already in use, Weise renamed it in Mulsant's honor.
