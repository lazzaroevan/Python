Luprisca incuba is an extinct species of ostracodâ€”a group related to crabs, shrimps and lobsters. It was described as a new species in 2014, following discovery and analysis of fossilised specimens in mudstone rocks from New York, United States. A team of researchers from the universities of Yale and Kansas, Oxford and the Japan Agency of Marine Science and Technology made the discovery.
