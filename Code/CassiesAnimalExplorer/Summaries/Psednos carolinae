Psednos carolinae is a species of snailfish only known from a single male specimen collected in mid-Indian Ocean in 1964.
This fish, 39 mm standard length, has a slender body and large head with the mouth angled upwards 90Â°. It can be distinguished from all other Psednos species by the low number of vertebrae (38).
