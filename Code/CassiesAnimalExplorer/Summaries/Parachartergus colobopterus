Parachartergus colobopterus is an epiponine social wasp belonging to the subfamily Polistinae. This species can be found through Central and South America and is unique because its colonies contain multiple queens. However, relatedness among nest mates remains relatively high as a result of cyclical oligogyny, which is a system where the number of queens varies over time. Because workers and queens do not demonstrate any significant morphological differentiation, individuals of this species are totipotent, capable of differentiation into any caste, because caste is not genetically determined. Relatedness and conflict therefore play a major role in determining the dominance hierarchy and behavioral patterns of this wasp species, especially the behavior of worker policing. Another unique characteristic of this wasp is that it is generally a docile species: when the nest is continuously provoked, the colony members will leave the nest instead of mounting an attack.
