The Cabanis's seedeater (Amaurospiza concolor) is a species of bird in the cardinal family Cardinalidae. It is found in highland forest and woodland, mainly near bamboo, in southern Mexico and Central America. Due to its association with bamboo, it is often local and erratic in occurrence, but overall it is not considered threatened and therefore listed as Least Concern by BirdLife International and IUCN.Cabanis's seedeater was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Ecuadorian seedeater under the common name "blue seedeater".Two subspecies are recognised:
A. c. relicta (Griscom, 1934) – southwest Mexico
A. c. concolor Cabanis, 1861 – south Mexico, Belize, Honduras to Panama
