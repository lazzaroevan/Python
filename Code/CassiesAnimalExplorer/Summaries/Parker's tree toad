"An African bufonid related to Nectophryne but differing in absence of lamelliform subdigital pads and in possession of a palatine bone; differing from Wolterstorffina, Bufo and Nectophrynoides in possessing only seven presacral vertebrae and in having the palatine reduced in extent, and from the last two genera also in the fusion of the sacrum and coccyx" (Tihen, 1960).
