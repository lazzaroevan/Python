Pseudotropheus cyaneorhabdos is a species of cichlid endemic to Lake Malawi where it is only known from around Likoma Island where it prefers rocky substrates at depths of from 5 to 10 metres (16 to 33 ft).  This species can grow to a length of 7.5 centimetres (3.0 in) SL. Also known as Maingano, this mbuna is often confused with P. johannii. One important distinguishing characteristic is that females are not orange, whereas female P. johanii are. Both male & female P. cyanerhabdos are colored the same; however, males may have more intense coloring, particularly in dominant or sexually active males.  Another key distinguishing feature of P. cyaneorhabdos from P. johannii is the lack of vertical stripes.
