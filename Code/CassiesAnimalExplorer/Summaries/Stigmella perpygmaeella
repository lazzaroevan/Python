Stigmella perpygmaeella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in most of Europe, east to Russia.
The wingspan is 5â€“6 mm. The thick erect hairs on the head vertex are yellow-white and the collar is also yellow-white. Antennal eyecaps yellow-white. Forewings are dark grey brown wth purple at the apex. Hindwings are grey.
Adults are on wing from April to May and again from June to August.

The larvae feed on Crataegus laevigata and Crataegus monogyna. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a corridor that quickly widens into a secondary blotch. The mine is constrained between two veins or, less frequently, a lateral vein and the leaf margin.
