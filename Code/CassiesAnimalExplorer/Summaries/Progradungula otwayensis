Progradungula otwayensis, commonly known as the odd-clawed spider, is a species of cribellate spider endemic to the Great Otway National Park of  Victoria, Australia. It is one of only two species in the gradungulid genus Progradungula.
Odd-clawed spiders are medium-sized to large spiders, with an approximate body length of 10 to 15 mm (0.39 to 0.59 in) and a leg span of 72 to 77 mm (2.8 to 3.0 in). They are lightly pigmented, from yellowish brown to light mauvish gray, with three chevron markings on the rear upper part of their abdomen. Like other gradungulids, their legs are tipped with three claws. These claws are particularly well-developed on the first and second leg pairs and are used for latching unto prey. They are ambush predators, building characteristic ladder-shaped snares close to the ground. They stand head-down on these webs waiting for prey which they then scoop up into these webs to trap them.
