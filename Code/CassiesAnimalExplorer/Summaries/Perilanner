The word perilanner is a falconer's term for a hybrid between a peregrine falcon and a lanner falcon. It is larger and faster than a lanner, but does not fly as far as a peregrine and thus is less likely to fly far away and become lost. As a rule, the peregrine is the father and the lanner is the mother. Perilanners are a popular choice for modern falconers.
Their flying range is between that of a lanner and that of a peregrine and makes them useful in keeping an airport clear of wild birds to prevent birdstrike.
