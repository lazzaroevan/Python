Argas keiransi is a species of argasid tick in the subgenus Persicargus that parasitizes the chimango, a falconid bird of prey found in the Sub-Antarctic biogeographical region; the type species was collected in Chill√°n, Chile.  The species name honors the scientific contributions of James E. Keirans.  A. keiransi is similar to, but morphologically distinct from, Argas giganteus Kohls & Clifford, 1968.
