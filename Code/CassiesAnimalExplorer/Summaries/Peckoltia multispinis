Peckoltia multispinis is a small freshwater fish in the genus Peckoltia of the catfish family Loricariidae. It has the L-number L049. It is possibly a junior synonym for Peckoltia vittata (Steindachner, 1881). However, the online Encyclopedia of Life lists this fish as Lasiancistrus multispinis. The California Academy of Sciences describes Peckoltia multispinis as the currently correct name.
