Parnassius arcticus, the Siberian Apollo, is a high-altitude butterfly which is found in Northeastern Yakutia, Russia. It is a member of the snow Apollo genus (Parnassius) of the swallowtail family, Papilionidae.
The taxonomic status of this butterfly is uncertain. It was originally described from females only as a Siberian subspecies of Parnassius simo, a species which does not occur in Siberia. Eisner, the author of the subspecies later decided it was conspecific with Parnassius tenedius. Korshunov & Gorbunov (1995) regard it as a good (full) species with ammosovi Korshunov as a junior synonym.
P. ammasovi lives on scree at 1,500 m. The adult flies mid-June to early July. Eggs are laid on stones around the host plant, Corydalis gorodkovi.
