Paratylenchus hamatus, the fig pin nematode, is a species of migratory plant endoparasites, that causes lesions on plant roots resulting in symptoms of chlorosis, wilting and ultimately yield losses.  They move and feed on different parts of host tissue throughout their life cycle in order to find enough susceptible host tissue to survive and reproduce.  A wide range of host plant species are susceptible to the fig pin nematode, including many valuable fruit and vegetable crops such as figs, carrots and celery. They are also commonly found associated with woody perennials in California.  P. hamatus inhabits soils in both Europe and North America, and was originally isolated from fig in central California in 1950.
