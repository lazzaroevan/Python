The family Prophalangopsidae (formerly known sometimes as Haglidae and the only extant taxon in the superfamily Hagloidea) are insects belonging to the order Orthoptera. There is only one extant genus in North America, where they are known as grigs, four genera in Asia, and many extinct genera (see below).
The closest living relatives to the Prophalangopsidae are the family Tettigoniidae (katydids or bush-crickets), but the evolutionary split occurred more than 230 million years ago in the Permian.The female of the species consumes the wings of the male during mating.
