Dasymutilla gloriosa, sometimes referred to as the thistledown velvet ant, is a member of the genus Dasymutilla. Only females are wingless, as in other mutillids.  It ranges from Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and south into Mexico.
Rather than having aposematic coloration like other mutillids, the females of this species are camouflaged by their resemblance to the fruit of Creosotebush, which occurs in the same habitats. However, this species' coloration appears to be primarily an adaptation to hot desert conditions instead of predation pressure; their internal and external body temperature are less compared to orange Dasymutilla species in the same habitat.
