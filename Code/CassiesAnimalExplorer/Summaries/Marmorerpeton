Marmorerpeton is an extinct genus of prehistoric stem-salamanders that lived in Europe during the Middle Jurassic. Remains are known from the Bathonian aged Forest Marble Formation of England and the Kilmaluag Formation of Scotland. They are among the earliest-known salamanders, and are probably older than Karaurus. The teeth appear to have been weakly pedicellate. The genus appears to have been neotenic, based on a few morphological characters  and on the presence of calcified cartilage in the medulla of its humerus.

The size of its osteocytic lacunae suggests that it had a fairly large genome (C-value of about 36.7 pg, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 30.2 to 44.2 pg), though not as large as that of obligatorily neotenic extant urodeles. This suggests that it may have been facultatively neotenic.
