The fairy martin (Petrochelidon ariel) is a member of the swallow family of passerine birds which breeds in Australia. It is migratory wintering through most of Australia, with some birds reaching New Guinea and Indonesia. It is increasingly a wanderer to New Zealand, where it may have bred. This species is frequently placed in the genus Hirundo  as Hirundo ariel. It is monotypic.
This is a bird of open country near water, and is usually seen near its nest sites in cliffs, culverts or bridges.
