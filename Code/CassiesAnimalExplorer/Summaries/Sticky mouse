Sticky mouse is a murine possessing a gene mutation in the enzyme alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS). The sticky mouse, with this particular mutation, presents a good model in which to investigate mechanisms of neuronal degeneration. Its most immediately obvious symptom is a sticky secretion on the mouse's fur (thus the name); however, it is accompanied by lack of muscle control, ataxia, alopecia, loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and eventually, death.
Sticky mouse is one of several animal mutants that are known to have problems in mRNA translation and are used in studies.
