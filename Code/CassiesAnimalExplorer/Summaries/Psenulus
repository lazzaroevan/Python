Psenulus is a genus of wasps in the family Crabronidae. The 160 species are found worldwide, but are best represented in the Indomalayan realm with 68. The Palearctic has 26, the Nearctic 4, and the Australasian realm 3. Psenulus is largely absent from South America (1 species) and entirely absent from Melanesia and Polynesia. A recent phylogenetic analysis provided strong evidence that this genus is the closest living relative to bees.
