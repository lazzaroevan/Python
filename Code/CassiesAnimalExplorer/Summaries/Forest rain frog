The forest rain frog (Breviceps sylvestris) is a species of frog in the family Brevicipitidae. It is endemic to Limpopo, South Africa. Two allopatric subspecies are recognized: the nominate one, Breviceps sylvestris sylvestris,  and Breviceps sylvestris taeniatus Poynton, 1963 from near Soutpansberg. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, temperate grassland, and rural gardens. It is threatened by habitat loss.Forest rain frogs can range in colour from red, orange, yellow, green, and purple.  They can also vary in size from a mere 2 cm and grow to be about 10 cm in body length. The purple frogs are known to contain a defense mechanism consisting of a toxic chemical on their slimy exterior.  If contact is made with this toxin the temporary effect of paralysis can occur.
