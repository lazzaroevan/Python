Paracarinachites is a genus of sclerite-bearing creatures known from the early Cambrian period, originating around 530-520 Ma. They are often represented within the distinguished small shelly fauna (SSF) group because of their minuscule size-from only a few millimeters long, and because of their overt mineralized skeletons. Most SSF are from the clade Lophotrochozoa, however, it is unclear whether Paracarinachites are identified for certain as there have been rare cases of ecdysozoan SSF. Little is still known about the animal due to limited fossil collections; there are currently 27 known collections from China according to Fossilworks.
