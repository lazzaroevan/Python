The Fresno kangaroo rat or San Joaquin kangaroo rat (Dipodomys nitratoides) is a species of rodent in the family Heteromyidae.  It is endemic to areas within and near the San Joaquin Valley of California in the United States. Habitat destruction due to agricultural development and urbanization has put this species at risk, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as "vulnerable".
There are three subspecies of D. nitratoides:
D. n. exilis (Merriam, 1894) (Fresno subspecies),
D. n. nitratoides (Merriam, 1894) (Tipton subspecies),
D. n. brevinasus (Grinnell, 1920) (short-nose subspecies).
