Selenops is a spider genus that is found in many deserts of the world. It is very hard to distinguish the 115 species.
S. australiensis is found on or under dry bark in Australia. The female reaches 9mm, the male 7mm. It looks superficially like a huntsman spider.
S. radiatus has proved to be an effective controlling agent of the potato tuber moth in South Africa.
Selenops is the first spider known to be able to steer and glide when falling, in order to land in or on a tree, instead of falling to the ground.Selenops spiders are able to attack prey approaching from all directions. When attacking prey from behind, they show some of the fastest turning movements documented in terrestrial legged animals.
