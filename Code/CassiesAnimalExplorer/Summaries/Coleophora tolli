Coleophora tolli is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found from Germany to the Pyrenees and Italy and from France to Slovakia.
The larvae mine Thymus species. They create a trivalved tubular silken case of 8-9.5 mm. The mouth angle is about 30Â°. The case is light brown and has a number of indistinct length lines. The mines are quite small at first, but later the leaves are completely mined out. Larvae can be found from autumn to June.
