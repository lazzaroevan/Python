Bulweria is a genus of seabirds in the family Procellariidae named after English naturalist James Bulwer. The genus has two extant species, Bulwer's petrel (B. bulwerii) and Jouanin's petrel (B. fallax). A third species, the Olson's petrel (Bulweria bifax), became extinct in the early 16th century; it is known only from skeletal remains.  Bulwer's Petrel ranges in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, whereas Joaunin's Petrel is confined to the northwestern Indian Ocean.  Olson's Petrel is known from the Atlantic.
Bulweria petrels have long been considered related to the gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma, but recent mtDNA cytochrome b sequence analysis has proven them to be closely related to the shearwaters in the genus Puffinus and especially the Procellaria petrels.
