Aphyocypris lini, the garnet minnow or Venus minnow, is a species of cyprinid endemic to China. It was first collected from Hong Kong by A.W. Herre in 1936. The introduction of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and habitat destruction caused the extirpation of this species from Hong Kong and the species was considered to be extinct in the wild. However, a similar species Aphyocypris pulchrilineata was discovered in Guangxi in southern China, but this species lacks the dark spot on the base of the caudal fin.Named in honor of Chinese ichthyologist Lin Shu-Yen (1903-1974).
