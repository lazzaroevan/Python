Dunn's gerbil (Gerbillus dunni) is a rodent species distributed mainly in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. It is an animal of dry grassland and rocky plains. It is also sometimes called the "Somalia gerbil", not to be confused with the Somalian gerbil or the Somali gerbil.
Dunn's gerbil was first described by the British zoologist Oldfield Thomas as Gerbillus dunni in 1904. Its karyotype is 2n=74. Its natural habitat is not under threat and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of "least concern".
