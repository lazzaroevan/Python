Mansonella streptocerca, (formerly Diptalonema streptocerca), is a filarial (arthropod-borne) nematode (roundworm) causing the disease streptocerciasis.  It is a common parasite in the skin of humans in the rain forests of Africa, where it is thought to be a parasite of chimpanzees, as well.Mansonella streptocerca is one of three filarial nematodes that cause subcutaneous filariasis in humans.  The other two filarial nematodes are Loa loa (the African eye worm), and Onchocerca volvulus (river blindness).
The worm is distributed across West and Central Africa.
