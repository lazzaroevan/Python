Parahelicoprion is an extinct genus of shark-like  eugeneodontid holocephalids from the Permian of the Ural Mountains and Copacabana Formation, Bolivia. The genus name, from "nearly coiled saw" in Greek, directly refers to Helicoprion, a related holocephalid that shares similar traits to it, including the helical whorl of teeth.
