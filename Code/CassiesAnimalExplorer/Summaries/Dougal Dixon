Dougal Dixon (born 9 May 1947) is a Scottish palaeontologist, geologist, educator and author. As a science writer, Dixon has written more than 210 books, most of them about dinosaurs. These dinosaur books, many of them for children, have been credited with attracting many to the study of the prehistoric animals and have won Dixon several awards.
He is perhaps most famous for his fictional "zoologies of the future", books in which Dixon explores imagined future and alternate worlds with fully realized imaginary ecosystems. These books, After Man (1981), The New Dinosaurs (1988), Man After Man (1990) and Greenworld (2010), all use their fictional settings to explain actual natural processes, with a heavy focus on evolution and natural selection. Through these books, Dixon is generally considered to be the founder of the modern speculative evolution genre.
