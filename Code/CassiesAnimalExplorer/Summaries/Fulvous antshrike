The fulvous antshrike (Frederickena fulva) is a monotypic species of antbird in the family Thamnophilidae. Formerly considered to be a subspecies of the undulated antshrike, it was determined to be a distinct species based on vocal differences. The species occurs from the western Amazon in eastern Ecuador, south-eastern Colombia, north-eastern Peru, and possibly extreme western Brazil. Only the female is overall fulvous with dark barring; the male is black with whitish barring.
