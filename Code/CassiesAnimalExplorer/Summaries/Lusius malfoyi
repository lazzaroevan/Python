Lusius malfoyi is a parasitoid wasp found in New Zealand. The species is named for Lucius Malfoy, a character in the fictional Harry Potter series of books by J.K. Rowling, although the genus was described in 1903. The species is the first in its genus described in New Zealand; although the holotype specimen was captured in 1981, it was not described until 2017. The species is geographically widespread in New Zealand but rare.
