The frecklebelly darter (Percina stictogaster) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish, a darter from the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. It primarily occurs in the upper Kentucky and Green river systems of eastern and central Kentucky and north-central Tennessee, being found mostly in the Cumberland Plateau and Highland Rim regions. The fish gets its name from gets its name from the scattered dark spots on its relatively pale underside. However, a possible more telling characteristic of the species is the systematical arrangement of the spots at the base of the tail as well as the continuous stripes down either side of the back. Total population size is unknown but figured to be relatively large.  The frecklebelly darter is a benthic darter that relies on invertebrates as its principal diet. The frecklebelly darter can be found primarily in creeks and small rivers with a moderate gradient and a pool/riffle type flow, and spends most of its time in midwater areas of the stream. The major threats of the frecklebelly darter include decimation through perturbations such as strip mining as well as stream channelization projects.  The darter is thought to have a high resilience with minimum population doubling time less than 15 months; it is also believed to have low vulnerability. Frecklebelly darter females contain about 100-300 mature ova depending on size. Fish become mature by age 1. Spawning in this darter species involves egg burial where the male mounts the female and deposits eggs in deep depressions created by receptive females.
