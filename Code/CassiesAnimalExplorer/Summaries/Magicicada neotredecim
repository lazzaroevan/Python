Magicicada neotredecim  is the most recently discovered species of periodical cicada. Like all Magicicada species, M. neotredecim has reddish eyes and wing veins and a black dorsal thorax. It has a 13-year life cycle but seems to be most closely related to the 17-year species Magicicada septendecim. Both species are distinguished by broad orange stripes on the abdomen and a unique high-pitched song said to resemble someone calling "weeeee-whoa" or "Pharaoh." They differ only in life cycle length.Another closely related 13-year species Magicicada tredecim differs very slightly from M. neotredecim, and for many years two were considered one species with slight differences in abdomen color and mitochondrial DNA suggesting a zone of hybridization or introgression between 13-year and 17-year -decim populations. Then in 1998, scientists studying recordings of the chorus sound of Brood XIX recognized that the low-pitch component of the chorus contained two peak frequencies in some midwestern populations, corresponding to the songs of two sympatric 13-yr species related to M. septendecim. Experiments subsequently demonstrated the existence of two populations of female cicadas that responded selectively based on the two male song frequencies. Because of their many similarities, M. neotredecim, M. tredecim, and M. septendecim are often described together as "decim periodical cicadas."
