Phyllonorycter loxozona is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from South Africa and Uganda. The record for Kenya is a misidentification of Cameraria torridella.
The length of the forewings is 2.8â€“3.2 mm. The forewings are elongate and the ground colour is ochreous brown with white markings. The hindwings are fuscous with a long shiny fringe of the same colour as the hindwing. Adults are on wing from early February to mid-May and from early October to mid-December.The larvae feed on Dombeya bagshawei, Dombeya emarginata and Dombeya rotundifolia. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a long, narrow gallery, mainly along the edge of the leaf. Later the larvae form a gall-like swelling near the base of the disc.
