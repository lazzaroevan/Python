Macrodontophion (meaning "long-toothed snake") is the name given to a dubious genus of lophotrocozoan from the Early Devonian Dniester Series of Ukraine. It was described by Adalbert Zborzewsky in 1834, but was never given a species epithet, and is considered a nomen dubium, because it is based on a single tooth.
