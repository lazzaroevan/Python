Compsolechia metadupa is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Walsingham in 1910. It is found in Mexico (Tabasco).The wingspan is 11â€“12 mm. There are olivaceous greenish and bronzy brownish reflections on the forewings and a broad plumbeous band near the base, running obliquely outward from the dorsum to the costa, is narrowly reduplicated beyond. From the middle of the dorsum arises a similar plumbeous band, which, attaining the costa obliquely before the cilia, is margined on its inner side by a somewhat triangular brownish fuscous costal spot, and on its outer side by a dorsal shade of the same colour. A triangular patch enclosing the apex and termen, with a dark line running through the middle of the cinereous terminal cilia, is also dark brownish fuscous, and is margined on its inner side by a pale cinereous line. The hindwings are dark chocolate-brown.
