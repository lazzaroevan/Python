Procuhy is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian temnospondyl amphibian in the family Trimerorhachidae represented by the type species Procuhy nazariensis from the Early Permian of Brazil. It was named in 2015 on the basis of a partial skull from the lower part of the Pedra de Fogo Formation in Parna√≠ba Basin, which is about 278 million years old. It was likely an aquatic predator that inhabited lakes and wetland areas. During the Early Permian the center of tetrapod diversity was in the equatorial regions of the supercontinent Pangea, and Procuhy was part of this fauna.
