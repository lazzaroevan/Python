Athyma is a genus of brush-footed butterflies. They are commonly known as the "true" or "typical" sergeants, to distinguish them from the false sergeants of the genus Pseudathyma, a fairly close relative from the Adoliadini tribe. The genus ranges from Tibet to the Solomon Islands, but does not occur in New Guinea or Australia.
