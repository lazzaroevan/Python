Populations of the Ameca River basin were formerly included in this species, but are now recognized as A. amecae.There are some minor local variations in the appearance of A. tincella, but they all have a dark spot at the base of the tail. The species generally is about 5–11.5 cm (2.0–4.5 in) in standard length.
