Paradecolya briseferi is a species of katydid endemic to the islands of Mauritius, where it only occurs in a single area of 4 km2 in a preserved forest. Due to its small range and the continuing decline of its habitat, it is assessed as a critically endangered species. The main threat to P. briseferi is the decline of the native forests of Mauritius due to the gradual destruction by clearance and non-native invasive plant species. The species occurs in the oldest managed area in the Brise Fer Nature Reserve which is the best preserved relict of the native Sapotaceae forest.
