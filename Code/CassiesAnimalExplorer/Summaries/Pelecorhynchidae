Pelecorhynchidae is a small family of flies. All of the genera were originally placed in the family Rhagionidae, and their elevation to family rank has been controversial.  Other phylogenetic analyses have supported Pelecorhynchidae as a distinct clade from Rhagionidae.  The adults of Pelecorhynchus mostly feed on nectar of Leptospermum flowers. Larvae have been collected in the damp margins of swamp areas, where they feed on earthworms.
