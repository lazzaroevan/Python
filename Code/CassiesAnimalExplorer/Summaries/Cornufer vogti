Cornufer vogti (common name: Admiralty Island webbed frog) is a species of frogs in the family Ceratobatrachidae. It is endemic to the Admiralty Islands, Papua New Guinea, where it is known from the Rambutyo Island, its type locality, and from the Manus Island. The specific name vogti honours Theodor Vogt (1881â€“1932), a German naturalist. Vogt described this species in 1912; however, the name he used, Rana ventricosus, was already used. Thus a replacement name Rana vogti was created by Heini Hediger in 1934.
