Sphictostethus is a genus of pepsine spider wasps which has a dispersed southern Pacific distribution which encompasses Chile, eastern Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, and is very similar to the distribution of the southern beeches of the genus Nothofagus.  The type species is S. gravesii, but the genus's greatest diversity is in Australia, especially in the more humid and temperate south east, with one species, S. insularis, endemic to Lord Howe Island.
