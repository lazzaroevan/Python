Astylosternus batesi is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is found in Cameroon south of Sanaga River, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, southwestern Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, and the extreme western Democratic Republic of the Congo (Mayombe). The specific name batesi honours George Latimer Bates, an American naturalist. However, its vernacular name is Benito River night frog, apparently in reference to its type locality, Benito River in Equatorial Guinea.
