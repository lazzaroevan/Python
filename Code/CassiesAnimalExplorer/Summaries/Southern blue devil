The southern blue devil (Paraplesiops meleagris) is a species of fish in the longfin family Plesiopidae endemic to southern Australia.  It is a close relative of the eastern blue devil (Paraplesiops bleekeri), which lives in the coastal waters of eastern Australia, and of the western blue devil (P. sinclairi), of southwestern Western Australia with which it is sometimes considered conspecific.
