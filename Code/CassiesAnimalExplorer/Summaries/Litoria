Litoria is a genus of Pelodryadidae tree frogs native to Australia, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, the Lesser Sunda Islands, and the Moluccan Islands. It is the only genus in the monotypic subfamily Litoriinae and are sometimes collectively referred to as Australasian treefrogs. They are distinguishable from other tree frogs by the presence of horizontal irises, no pigmentation of the eyelids, and their distribution east and south from Wallacea. Over 90 species are described, but several new species are described every year on average, such as the Pinocchio frog, discovered in 2008 and described in 2019.The species within the genus Litoria are extremely variable in appearance, behaviour, and habitat. The smallest species is the javelin frog (L. microbelos), reaching a maximum snout–to–vent length of 1.6 cm (0.6 in), while the largest, the giant tree frog (L. infrafrenata), reaches a size of 13.5–14 cm (5.3–5.5 in). The appearance, behaviour, and habitat of each frog is usually linked. The small, darkly coloured frogs are generally terrestrial, and never, or infrequently, climb. The larger, green species are usually arboreal and some only venture to the ground to breed.
