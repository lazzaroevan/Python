Hyalinobatrachium ruedai is a species of frog in the family Centrolenidae. It is known from its type locality, Chiribiquete National Park in Caquetá Department of Colombia (although some confusion exists whether the type locality might be in the Vaupés Department, instead), as well as from Amazonian Ecuador, and is presumably to be found also in the nearby Peruvian Amazonas.H. ruedai is associated with small tepuis. It occurs in the dense understorey of old-growth forest near small streams. Eggs are laid on vegetation above water; the larvae develop in streams.H. ruedai is considered a rare species, but suitable habitat is plentiful, and no significant threats have been identified.
