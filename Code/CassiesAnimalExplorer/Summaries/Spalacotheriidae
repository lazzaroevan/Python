Spalacotheriidae is a family of extinct mammals belonging to the group Symmetrodonta. They were a rather successful lineage, lasting from the Early Cretaceous to Campanian in North America, Europe, Asia and North Africa. The lack of a Meckelian groove indicate that they had a modern ear anatomy, and their deciduous canines and premolars as well as long lower jaw indicate a carnivorous/insectivorous diet.
