Phillipsiidae is a family of proetid trilobites, the various genera of which comprise some of the last of the trilobites, with a range that extended from the Kinderhookian epoch of the Lower Mississippian, to the end of Changhsingian age at Permian-Triassic extinction event in the latest Permian period.Phillipsiidae is sometimes defined as a subfamily, "Phillipsiinae," and usually placed within the  family Proetidae. Jell & Adrain (2003) went so far as to lump Phillipsiidae into the family Proetidae, however other workers since like Lerosey-Aubril and Feist (2005) have continued to recognize Phillipsiidae as a distinct and separate family within Proetida.
