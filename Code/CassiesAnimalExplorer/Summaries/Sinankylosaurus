Sinankylosaurus (meaning "Chinese fused lizard") is a genus of ankylosaurian dinosaur from the late Cretaceous Period of Shandong, China. The genus contains a single species, Sinankylosaurus zhuchengensis, known from a near-complete right illium. The describers explain that the discovery of Sinankylosaurus not only expands knowledge of Zhucheng dinosaur species, it also shows the similarity between dinosaurs of eastern Asia and North America.
