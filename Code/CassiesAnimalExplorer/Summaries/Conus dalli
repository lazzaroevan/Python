Conus dalli, common name Dall's cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
Not to be confused with † Conus dalli Toula, 1911 which is, according to Fossilworks, a synonym of † Conus imitator Brown and Pilsbry 1911
