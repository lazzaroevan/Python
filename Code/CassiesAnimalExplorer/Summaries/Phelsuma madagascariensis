Phelsuma madagascariensis is a species of day gecko that lives in Madagascar. It is among the most widespread day geckos and is found in a wide range of habitats. With a length of up to 30.5 centimetres (12.0 in), it is also the largest day gecko in Madagascar. (The highly restricted Round Island day gecko is the only other extant species with a similar maximum length; the extinct Rodrigues giant day gecko was even larger.)
