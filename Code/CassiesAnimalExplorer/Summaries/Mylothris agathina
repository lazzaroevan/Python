Mylothris agathina, the eastern dotted border or common dotted border, is a butterfly of the family Pieridae, which is native to sub-Saharan Africa, particularly East and southern Africa. In South Africa its range has spread westwards around the coast in the late 20th century, and it now occurs north of Cape Town to somewhat beyond Saldanha.The wingspan is 50–60 millimetres (2.0–2.4 in) for males and 52–65 mm (2.0–2.6 in) for females. The slow-flying adults are on wing year-round, with peaks in October and from late February to April. The gregarious larvae feed on Tapinanthus oleifolius, Tapinanthus rubromarginatus, Erianthemum dregei, Teighemia quinquenervia, Ximenia caffra, Osyris lanceolata, and Osyris compressa (formerly Colpoon compressum). The pupae resemble bird droppings.
