The long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis) is a species of common dolphin.  It has a more restricted range than the short-beaked common dolphin (D. delphis).  It has a disjointed range in coastal areas in tropical and warmer temperate oceans.  The range includes parts of western and southern Africa, much of western South America, central California to central Mexico, coastal Peru, areas around Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and possibly near Oman. Vagrants have been recorded as far north as Vancouver Island. They live in shallow, warmer temperature waters near the coast. They also live in the tropical and subtropical regions.
