Paramiacis is an extinct genus of Miacidae. Christian Mathis has defined to make a difference between the miacids from Europe and the American genus Miacis. There are two species of it, P. exilis (Henri Filhol, 1876) and P. teilhardi (Mathis, 1987) - which were long believed to be only sexual dimorphism.
