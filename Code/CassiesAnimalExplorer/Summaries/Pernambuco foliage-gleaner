The Pernambuco foliage-gleaner (Automolus lammi) is a species of bird in the family Furnariidae. It is found in forests of north-eastern Brazil. Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the white-eyed foliage-gleaner. The morphology of the two is very similar, but their voices differ significantly. The Pernambuco foliage-gleaner is restricted to a region with extensive habitat destruction, and is considered vulnerable by BirdLife International.
