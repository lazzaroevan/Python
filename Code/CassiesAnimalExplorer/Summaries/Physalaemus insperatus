It is endemic to southern Brazil and is only known from its type locality, Serra da Pedra Branca do Araraquara in Guaratuba, Paran√°. The specific name insperatus means "unexpected" or "surprising" in Latin and alludes to the fortuitous finding of a new species among old museum specimens, originally identified as Physalaemus olfersii; taxonomically, it is part of the so-called Physalameus olfersii species group.
