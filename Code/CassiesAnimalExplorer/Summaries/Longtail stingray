"Longtail stingray" may also refer to Dasyatis thetidis or Himantura uarnak.

The longtail stingray (Dasyatis longa, often misspelled longus), is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Baja California to Colombia. It inhabits sandy habitats down to a depth of 90 m (300 ft). Measuring up to 1.56 m (5.1 ft) across, this species has a rhomboid pectoral fin disc, a lower (but not upper) fin fold on the tail, and numerous dermal denticles along the back and behind the stinging spine. The longtail stingray feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and crustaceans. It is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to 1â€“5 young in late summer. It is caught for food, likely throughout its range, but specific fishery data is lacking.
