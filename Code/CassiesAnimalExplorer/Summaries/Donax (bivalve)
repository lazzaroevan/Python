Donax is a genus of small, edible saltwater clams, marine bivalve molluscs. The genus is sometimes known as bean clams or wedge shells; however, Donax species have numerous different common names in different parts of the world. In the southeastern US they are known as "coquina", a word that is also used for the hard limestone concretions of their shells and those of other marine organisms.
