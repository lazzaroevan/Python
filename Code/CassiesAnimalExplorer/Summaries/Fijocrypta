Fijocrypta is a monotypic genus of South Pacific brushed trapdoor spiders containing the single species, Fijocrypta vitilevu. Both genus and species were first described by Robert Raven in 1994, and they have only been found in Fiji. It was first found in rainforests in the eastern highlands of Viti Levu, the largest island in Fiji, from which the species name is derived. The genus name is derived from "Fiji" and the Latin word cryptus, meaning "hidden".
