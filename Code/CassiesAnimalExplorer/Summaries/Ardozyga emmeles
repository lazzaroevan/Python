Ardozyga emmeles is a species of moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Turner in 1933. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland.The wingspan is 14–16 mm (0.55–0.63 in). The forewings are pale brown partly suffused with darker brown and with dark fuscous costal dots at the base and one-sixth, and on the dorsum at one-sixth preceded by a sub-dorsal dot. There are five oblique fuscous marks on the costa from one-third to the apex, their apices running into a subcostal fuscous suffusion, which is cut by an oblique white line, partly fuscous in the center from two-fifths of the costa to the middle of the disc. There is a short blackish streak from the apex, separated from the subcostal suffusion by a white dot. There is also an interrupted white terminal line doubly edged with fuscous. The hindwings are grey-whitish.
