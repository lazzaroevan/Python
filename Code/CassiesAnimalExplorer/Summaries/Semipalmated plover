The semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) is a small plover. The genus name Charadrius is a Late Latin word for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate. It derives from Ancient Greek kharadrios a bird found in ravines and river valleys (kharadra, "ravine"). The specific  semipalmatus  is  Latin and comes from  semi, "half" and palma, "palm". Like the English name, this refers to its only partly webbed feet.
