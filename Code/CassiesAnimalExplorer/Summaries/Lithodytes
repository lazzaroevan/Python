Lithodytes is a genus of frogs in the family Leptodactylidae. It is monotypic, being represented by the single species, Lithodytes lineatus, the gold-striped frog or painted antnest frog. It is found in tropical South America where it lives in humid forests among the leaf litter. These frogs build foam nests at the edge of temporary pools, and the tadpoles develop within these. The frogs also associate with certain leafcutter ants and breed inside their nests without being attacked by the ants.
