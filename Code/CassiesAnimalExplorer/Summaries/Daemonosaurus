Daemonosaurus is an extinct genus of possible theropod dinosaur from the Late Triassic of New Mexico. Fossils have been found from deposits in the Chinle Formation, which is latest Triassic in age. While theropods had diversified into several specialized groups by this time, Daemonosaurus is likely a very basal theropod (if one at all), and lies outside the clade Neotheropoda. Daemonosaurus is unusual among putative early theropods in that it had a short skull with long protruding teeth.
