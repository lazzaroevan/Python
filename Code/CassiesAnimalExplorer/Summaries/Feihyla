Feihyla is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae, subfamily Rhacophorinae. They are found in southern China and Vietnam, and likely also in Laos. Its phylogenetic position is not yet fully resolved, but it is probably the sister taxon to Taruga, Polypedates, and Rhacophorus. Feihyla was originally erected to resolve polyphyly of Chirixalus by absorbing "Chirixalus palpebralis".
