The long-toed skink (Oligosoma longipes) is a species of skink of the family Scincidae, endemic to New Zealand.  It was first described by Geoff Patterson in 1997. It is only known from a few sites in the South Island of New Zealand and little is known of its habits. It seems to prefer dry, rocky habitats, usually eroding stream terraces or scree slopes. It is diurnal and heliothermic. Maximum snout-vent length is about 70 mm.
