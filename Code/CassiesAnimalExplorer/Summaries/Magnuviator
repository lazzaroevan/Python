Magnuviator is a genus of extinct iguanomorph lizard from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, US. It contains one species, M. ovimonsensis, described in 2017 by DeMar et al. from two specimens that were discovered in the Egg Mountain nesting site. Magnuviator is closest related to the Asian Saichangurvel and Temujinia, which form the group Temujiniidae. Unlike other members of the Iguanomorpha, however, Magnuviator bears a distinct articulating notch on its tibia for the ankle bones (astragalus and calcaneum), which has traditionally been considered a characteristic of non-iguanomorph lizards. The morphology of its teeth suggests that its diet would have mainly consisted of wasps, like the modern phyrnosomatid iguanians Callisaurus and Urosaurus, although it also shows some adaptations to herbivory.
