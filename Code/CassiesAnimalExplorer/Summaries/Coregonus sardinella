Coregonus sardinella, known as the sardine cisco, and in North America as the least cisco, is a fresh- and brackishwater species of salmonid fish that inhabits rivers, estuaries and coastal waters of the marginal seas of the Arctic Basin, as well as some large lakes of those areas.
In North America it is found from the Murchison River (Nunavut) west through the Bering Strait to the Bristol Bay (Bering Sea) in Alaska, and in the Russian Arctic from the northern part of the Bering Sea across the Arctic coast to Kara Sea and Kara River at the north end of the Urals. It has been introduced in some lakes and rivers in Uzbekistan.
Coregonus sardinella is closely related to the European cisco or vendace  Coregonus albula, and also is close to the Siberian peled whitefish C. peled.
