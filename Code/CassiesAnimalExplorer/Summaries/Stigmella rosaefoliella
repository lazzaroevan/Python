Stigmella rosaefoliella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in North America in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, New York, Michigan, Missouri and Ontario.

The wingspan is about 4.5 mm. There are three generations per year with full grown larvae in June and early July, in August and in October.
The larvae feed on Rosa species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is serpentine and usually much contorted, frequently closely following the edge of the leaf in its early course, with a broad line of frass. The larvae are green. The cocoon is yellowish brown and much flattened.
