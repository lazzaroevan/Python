The spider-tailed horned viper (Pseudocerastes urarachnoides) is a species of viper, a venomous snake in the family Viperidae. The species is endemic to western Iran, and was originally described in 2006. The head looks very similar to that of other Pseudocerastes species in the region, but the spider-tailed horned viper has a unique tail that has a bulb-like end that is bordered by long drooping scales that give it the appearance of a spider. The tail tip is waved around and used to lure insectivorous birds to within striking range.
