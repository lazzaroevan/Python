Calamoneta is a genus of southeastern Asian spiders within the family Cheiracanthiidae. It was originally placed in the Miturgidae, but it was moved by Ramírez in 2014. It was named and first described by Christa Deeleman-Reinhold in 2001. The name is derived from the Greek "kalamos", meaning "something woven". There are two species in this genus, C. djojosudharmoi – the type species – and C. urata.
