Congiopodidae is a family of scorpaeniform fishes native to the southern hemisphere, commonly known as pigfishes, horsefishes and racehorses.
Congiopids live on the bottom of shallow temperate and sub-Antarctic seas, at depths of up to 600 metres (2,000 ft). They lack scales, and have a projecting snout with a small mouth.The Congiopodid is usually found in tropical environments being this species' most suitable area of settlement for successful development. There was one Congiopodid found in the shallow South American water. The adult's dorsal fin is relatively shorter than the juvenile's fin, but they all resemble yellow and orange dead tree leaves.
