Atelopus coynei, the Rio Faisanes stubfoot toad, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae endemic to Ecuador. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and rivers. It is threatened by habitat loss.It was named after evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne, who collected the holotype in a swamp on a frogging trip to western Ecuador as a student in the late 1970s.  It was thought to be extinct for many years, but was observed and photographed on February 7, 2012.Atelopus coynei can be differentiated from other similar species by its ventral patterning, thick fleshy finger webbing that covers its first finger, and from its long hind limbs that cause its heels to overlap when the legs are positioned perpendicular to the body (Miyata 1980).
