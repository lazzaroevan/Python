Pasilobus hupingensis is a species of spider in the orb-weaver spider family Araneidae, found in China and Japan. Females of the genus Pasilobus construct "spanning-thread webs" with only two sectors, making them appear triangular. Widely spaced threads with sticky drops span the three radii of these webs. One end is attached in such a way that it readily breaks free. When a prey item is caught on one of these threads, the line parts at this end and the prey hangs from the web until it is hauled up by the spider.
