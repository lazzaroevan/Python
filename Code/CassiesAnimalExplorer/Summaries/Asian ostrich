The Asian or Asiatic ostrich (Struthio asiaticus), is an extinct species of ostrich that ranged from Morocco, the Middle East to China and Mongolia. Fossils date from the upper Pliocene to the early Holocene (3.6 MYA - 8,000 cal yr BP). Beads made from shells taken from archaeological sites in India dating to more than 25000 years were found to have traces of DNA and analysis of sequences examined from them show that the species is definitely in the genus Struthio.

Asian ostriches were widespread around Asia. They also used to live in northern Indian Subcontinent and southern Siberia. In China, it is known that Asiatic ostriches became extinct at the end or shortly after the end of the last Ice Age.
