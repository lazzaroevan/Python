Coleophora ibipennella is a moth of the case-bearer family (Coleophoridae). It was first described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1849 and is found in Asia, Europe and North Africa. The larva feed within a pistol case on oak leaves (Quercus species) and in the past was confused with Coleophora betulella, whose larva feed from a similar looking pistol case on birch leaves (Betula species).
