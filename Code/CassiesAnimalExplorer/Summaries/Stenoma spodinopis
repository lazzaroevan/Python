Stenoma spodinopis is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931. It is found in Brazil.The wingspan is 14â€“16 mm. The forewings are pale grey, with the extreme costal edge white and the stigmata blackish, the plical obliquely beyond the first discal. There is a dark fuscous subquadrate spot on the costa before the middle, and a second less developed midway between this and the apex. One or two small cloudy dark fuscous marks are found between the first costal spot and the second discal stigma. There is also a cloud of grey suffusion extending from beyond the second discal stigma to the dorsum and a rather excurved grey line from the second costal spot to the tornus, sharply indented beneath the costa. A marginal series of black dots is found around the apex and termen. The hindwings are grey.
