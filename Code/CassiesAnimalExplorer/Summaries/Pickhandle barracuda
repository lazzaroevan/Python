The pickhandle barracuda (Sphyraena jello) is so called because the dark marks along its sides look like the thick ends of pickaxe handles. These dark markings fade under preservation.
Sea anglers sometimes colloquially shorten the name to "pick".
The pickhandle barracuda's spawning takes place in the Iranian Bushehr coastal water.
A 2006â€“2007 investigation on the biological habitat and characteristics of Sphyraena jello found that the species' feeding takes place after releasing its gonads to spawn. This release creates space for the stomach to magnify its capacity for appropriate feeding (Halpern, 2004). This takes place in October and November.
