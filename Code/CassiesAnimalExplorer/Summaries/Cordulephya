Cordulephya is a genus of dragonflies in the family Cordulephyidae, endemic to eastern Australia. 
The species are small to tiny in size, coloured black, or purplish-black, with yellowish markings. Unusually for Anisoptera, these dragonflies rest with their wings folded above their body in a similar manner to many species of damselfly. They are commonly known as shutwings.
