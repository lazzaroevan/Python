Pempheris mangula, the black-edged sweeper, Moluccan sweeper or black-margin bullseye is a species of Indo-Pacific sweeper from the family Pempheridae. The history of the identification of the Indo-Pacific sweepers is complex and this species has been identified as the "Pempheris vanicolensis" which has colonised the Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal by Lessepsian migration but this identification is not universally accepted.
