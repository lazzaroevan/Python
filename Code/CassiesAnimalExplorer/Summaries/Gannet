Gannets are seabirds comprising the genus Morus, in the family Sulidae, closely related to boobies. "Gannet" is derived from Old English ganot, ultimately from the same Old Germanic root as "gander". Morus is derived from  Ancient Greek moros, "foolish", due to the lack of fear shown by breeding gannets and boobies, allowing them to be easily killed.Gannets are large white birds with yellowish heads; black-tipped wings; and long bills. Northern gannets are the largest seabirds in the North Atlantic, having a wingspan of up to 2 m (6.6 ft). The other two species occur in the temperate seas around southern Africa, southern Australia, and New Zealand.
Gannets hunt fish by diving into the sea from a height and pursuing their prey underwater, and have a number of adaptations:

They have no external nostrils; they are located inside the mouth, instead.
They have air sacs in the face and chest under the skin, which act like bubble wrap, cushioning the impact with the water.
The position of their eyes is far enough forward on the face for binocular vision, allowing them to judge distances accurately.Gannets can dive from a height of 30 m (100 ft), achieving speeds of 100 km/h (60 mph) as they strike the water, enabling them to catch fish at a much greater depth than most airborne birds.
The gannet's supposed capacity for eating large quantities of fish has led to "gannet" becoming a description of somebody with a voracious appetite.
