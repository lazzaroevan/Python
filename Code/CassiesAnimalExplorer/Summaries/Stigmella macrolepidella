Stigmella macrolepidella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in mainland Greece (the north and Peloponnesos), Rhodes, Turkey and possibly Haifa in Israel.
The wingspan is 3.8-4.7 mm. Adults are on wing in May, June, August and reared from September to October.
The larvae feed on Quercus macrolepis. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a full depth corridor. The first section of this corridor is filled with frass. Later sections are mostly free of frass.
