The paradise kingfishers (genus Tanysiptera) are a group of tree kingfishers endemic to New Guinea â€” with the exception of two species also present in the Moluccas and Queensland.
The genus was erected by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825.  The type species is the common paradise kingfisher. The name Tanysiptera is from classical Greek tanusipteros meaning "long-feathered". The birds in the genus have distinctive long tail streamers.
