The Atlantic trumpetfish, Aulostomus strigosus (or incorrectly Atlantic coronetfish) is a species of trumpetfish in the family Aulostomidae. It is a tropical marine fish found in shallow coastal waters in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Mauritania to Namibia. Like other trumpetfish, they eat mainly small fish and often shadow other piscivores while hunting.Aulostomus strigosus was found to be very closely related to Aulostomus maculatus, strongly supporting the theory that A. strigosus traversed the Atlantic to come to inhabit the Southeast Pacific.
