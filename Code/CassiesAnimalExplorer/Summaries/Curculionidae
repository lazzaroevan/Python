The Curculionidae are the family of the "true" weevils (or "snout beetles").  They are one of the largest animal families, with 6,800 genera and 83,000 species described worldwide. They are the sister group to the subfamily BrentidaeThey include the bark beetles as the subfamily Scolytinae, which are modified in shape in accordance with their wood-boring lifestyle. They do not much resemble other weevils, so they were traditionally considered a distinct family, Scolytidae. The family also includes the ambrosia beetles, of which the present-day subfamily Platypodinae was formerly considered the distinct family Platypodidae.
