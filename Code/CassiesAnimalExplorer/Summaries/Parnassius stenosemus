Parnassius stenosemus is a high-altitude butterfly which is found in north India (Ladakh). 
It is a member of the snow Apollo genus (Parnassius) of the swallowtail family (Papilionidae).
P. stenosemus was originally described as a subspecies of P. delphius and has also been regarded as conspecific with P. stoliczkanus. It was treated as a good (true) species by Felix Bryk in 1935, a view accepted by many later authors including Weiss (1992).
