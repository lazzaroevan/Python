Seeleyosaurus is an extinct genus of plesiosaur. It is known from a large almost complete skeleton from the Upper Lias (Toarcian) of WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. There seems to be the impression of a rhomboidal flap of skin in a vertical plane; if so, many plesiosaurs may have been equipped in this way. The holotype was destroyed in 1945 (WWII) and only a cast exists today. A second specimen, preserved in 3D, has survived until today.
