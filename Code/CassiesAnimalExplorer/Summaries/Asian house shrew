The Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) is a shrew species native to South and Southeast Asia that has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008 because of its large population and wide distribution. It has been introduced in several West Asian and East African countries.
It is considered an invasive species and implicated in the demise of several island lizard species.It is also called house shrew, grey musk shrew, Asian musk shrew or Indian musk shrew.
In India, it is called chuchunder and is mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book by the name of chuchundra as a nocturnal inhabitant of Indian houses. However, Kipling's mistaken use of the name 'musk rat' has led to confusion with the unrelated North American muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and the latter species, not found in India, was (erroneously) illustrated in the Jungle Book.
