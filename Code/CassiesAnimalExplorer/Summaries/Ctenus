Ctenus is a genus of wandering spiders first described by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1805. It is widely distributed, from South America through Africa to East Asia. Little is known about the toxic potential of the genus Ctenus, however, it was recently discovered that the species Ctenus medius shares toxic properties with those presented by Phoneutria nigriventer, such as proteolytic, hyaluronidase and phospholipase activities, in addition to producing hyperalgesia and edema, the venom of C. medius also interferes with the complement system in concentrations in which the venom of P. nigriventer is inactive, indicating that this spider has a noxious venom to humans. The venom of C. medius causes an eleavage in the complement component 3 (C3) of the complement system, it affects the central factor of the cascades of the complement, and interferes with the lytic activity of this system, which causes stronger activation and consumption of the complement components. Unlike C. medius, the venom of P. nigriventer does not interfere with lytic activity.
