Arganodus is an extinct genus of Ceratodontidae (lungfish). Its fossils have been found in the Redonda Formation, New Mexico, the Tacuaremb√≥  Formation of Uruguay, and the Cumnock Formation, North Carolina, although the North Carolinian specimens are smaller than most recorded specimens. Fossils have also been uncovered in the Petrified Forest National Park. It was first named by Martin in 1979, and contains two species, A. dorotheae and A. atlantis. Arganodus was probably similar to modern lungfish, and lived in underwater burrows during dry periods until monsoons occurred.
