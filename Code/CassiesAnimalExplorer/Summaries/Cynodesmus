Cynodesmus is an extinct genus of omnivorous canine which inhabited North America during the Oligocene living from 33.3â€”-26.3 Ma and existed for approximately 7 million years.
Cynodesmus was one of the first canids to truly look dog-like. At around 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length, it was about the same size as a modern coyote, but had a shorter skull, heavier tail, and longer rump. The shape of its limbs suggests that Cynodesmus was not a very good runner compared to most other canids; it probably attacked prey from an ambush. Unlike modern dogs, it had five toes on each foot, bearing partially retractable claws.
