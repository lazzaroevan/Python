Phrynobatrachus keniensis is a species of frog in the family Phrynobatrachidae. It is found widely in the highlands of Kenya (Cherang'any Hills in the northwest, Nyambene Hills in the northeast, and from several locations in the Central Highlands, for example from Mount Kenya and the Aberdare Range). It is also recorded from Mount Meru in northern Tanzania, but this might represent a different species. Common names Kenya River frog and upland puddle frog have been coined for it.
