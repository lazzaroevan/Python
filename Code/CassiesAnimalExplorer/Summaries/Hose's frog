Hose's frog (Odorrana hosii, often misspelled as O. hosei) is a true frog species with a wide range in Southeast Asia. This species was named after zoologist Charles Hose.
Its closest living relatives appear to be O. chloronota which occurs to the north of Hose's frog's range, as well as O. livida and O. morafkai with a more limited range in Myanmar and Vietnam, respectively; these four appear to form a close-knit group wherein the northern species are barely closer to each other than Hose's frog is to any of them. Also quite closely related is O. megatympanum, another Vietnamese endemic.
