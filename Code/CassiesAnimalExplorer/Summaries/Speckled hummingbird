The speckled hummingbird (Adelomyia melanogenys), is a species of hummingbird. It is the only member of the genus Adelomyia. It inhabits Neotropical montane cloud forests at elevations of 1,000–2,500 meters and is confined to the Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela; as well as to some isolated montane forest in western Ecuador and Venezuela. In Ecuador, it ranges across both eastern and western slopes of the Andes and occupies a broad altitudinal range from subtropical forests (1400 m) to cloud forests (3000 m). In addition, one isolated population inhabits the Chongón Colonche cordillera in coastal evergreen montane forest (600 m) located ca. 130 km away from the Andes.
