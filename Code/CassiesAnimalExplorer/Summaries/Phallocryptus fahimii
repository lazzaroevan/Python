The fairy shrimp, Phallocryptus fahimii, is a fresh water crustacea discovered in 2017 from a seasonal lake in the Lut Desert in southeast Iran. It's a heat-resistant crustacea living in a lake with water temperatures reaching 87 °F (31 °C). This species is just the fifth known species to be discovered in the genus Phallocryptus. It received its name after the late Hadi Fahimii, a conservationist who took part in the expedition of the Lut Desert and died in 2018 from an airplane crash. Morphologically, this newly discovered species shows minimal differences from its relatives in the Phallocryptus genus. A distinguishing characteristic of this fairy shrimp is that it can lay its eggs in desert sand for decades while they await the rare presence of water. P. fahimii developed these unique characteristics due to its harsh environmental conditions throughout the Lut Desert, which in Farsi, translates into “desert of emptiness.” Dr.Hossein Rajaei, one of the researchers that made the shrimp discovery, suggested, “they gave it this name because many people believed there was no life in this desert.”
