Homosteus is a genus of flattened arthrodire placoderm from the Middle Devonian.  Fossils are found primarily in Eifelian-epoch aged strata of Europe, Canada, Greenland, and Estonia.  All of the species had comparatively large, flattened heads with, as suggested by the upward opening orbits, upward-pointing eyes.  These adaptations suggest that the various species were benthic predators. A study on Titanichthys, in contrast, suggests that species of Homosteus may have been filter-feeders instead.
