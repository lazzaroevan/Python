Paruroctonus boreus, sometimes called the northern scorpion, is a species of scorpion of the family Vaejovidae that can be as far north as 51Â° N. Several anecdotal reports show them found near Medicine Hat, Alberta during dry years.  It is the only scorpion found in Canada, with specimens collected in the Okanagan valley of British Columbia and more widely in Alberta.
