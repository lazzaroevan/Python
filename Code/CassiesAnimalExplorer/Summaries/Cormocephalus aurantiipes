Cormocephalus aurantiipes is a common species of centipede found throughout Australia, often confused with Cormocephalus westwoodi. It can be found in every Australian state except Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Like most centipedes it comes in many different "colour forms", depending on locality.
C. aurantiipes is a medium-sized centipede, capable of reaching lengths of up to 140 millimetres (5.5 in), but more commonly found around 100 mm (3.9 in).
