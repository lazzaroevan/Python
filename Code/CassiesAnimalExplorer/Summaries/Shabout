The shabout (Arabibarbus grypus) is a species of cyprinid fish also called in English, Persian or Arabic by the alternate common names shirbot and variations shabut, shabboot or shabbout, and in local languages by several other common names. It is a large freshwater carp found in Western Asia, where it inhabits the Tigris-Euphrates Basin, as well as Iranian rivers that flow into the Persian Gulf.This species can grow to a length of up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) and a weight of 30 kg (66 lb), although there are unconfirmed reports of individuals up to 2 m (6.6 ft) and 100 kg (220 lb), perhaps caused by confusion with the mangar (Luciobarbus esocinus). The shabout supports important fisheries, but has declined because of habitat loss (mostly due to dams, water extraction, drought and pollution) and overfishing.
