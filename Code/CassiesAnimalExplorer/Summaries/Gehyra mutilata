Gehyra mutilata, also known as the common four-clawed gecko, stump-toed gecko, tender-skinned house gecko, sugar gecko, Pacific gecko, or butiki, is a type of house gecko that is native to Southeast Asia and Australia. It has made its way to several areas of the world including Sri Lanka, Indochina, and many of the Pacific Islands. Compared to common house geckos, this gecko's appearance is somewhat plump, with delicate skin. The skin is usually colored a soft purplish/pinkish gray with golden spots on younger specimens; these spots eventually fade with age.
