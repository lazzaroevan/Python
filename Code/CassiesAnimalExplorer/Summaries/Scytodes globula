Scytodes globula, the Chilean tiger spider, is a predatory spider of the family Scytodidae. In Spanish, it is known as ara√±a tigre, or "tiger spider", but is also well known as "long-legged spider" (because of the disproportional size of those members) or "spitting spider" (because of its hunting methods, in which it projects an extremely sticky web which immobilizes its prey). It has achieved fame by being the only natural predator of the extremely common and dangerous Chilean recluse spider (Loxosceles laeta).
