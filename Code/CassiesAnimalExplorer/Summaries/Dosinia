Dosinia is a genus of saltwater clams, marine bivalve molluscs in the family Veneridae, subfamily Dosiniinae Deshayes, 1853. The shell of Dosinia species is disc-like in shape, usually white, and therefore is reminiscent of the shells of Lucinid bivalves.
The genus is known from the Cretaceous to the Recent periods (age range: 99.7 to 0.0 million years ago). Fossils of species within this genus have been found all over the world.
