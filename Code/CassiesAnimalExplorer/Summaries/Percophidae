The Percophidae, duckbills, are a family of percomorph fishes, from the order Trachiniformes, found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and in the southwestern and southeastern Pacific.
They are small fishes: the largest species, the Brazilian flathead, Percophis brasiliensis, grows up to about 50 centimetres (20 in), but 10 centimetres (3.9 in) to 20 centimetres (7.9 in) is more typical. A few species are fished commercially, including the Brazilian flathead.
