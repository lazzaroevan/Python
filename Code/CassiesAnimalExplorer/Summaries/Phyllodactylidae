The Phyllodactylidae are a family of geckos (Gekkota) consisting of approximately 148 species, distributed throughout the New World, North Africa, Europe and the Middle East. The Phyllodactylidae were described based on a molecular phylogenetic analysis in 2008 and all members possess a unique single codon deletion in the phosducin (PDC) gene. The phyllodactylid genus Bogertia has been recently synonymized with Phyllopezus.
