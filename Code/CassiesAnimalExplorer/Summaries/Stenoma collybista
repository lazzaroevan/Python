Stenoma collybista is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1915. It is found in Peru.The wingspan is 21â€“22 mm. The forewings are whitish-grey ochreous, sometimes partially suffused with pale violet grey and with the costal edge yellow whitish, at the base dark fuscous. There is a small triangular dark fuscous spot on the costa beyond one-fourth (sometimes obsolete), and larger ones in the middle and beyond three-fourths. The stigmata are small, indistinct and dark grey, the plical obliquely beyond the first discal. There is some faint brownish suffusion towards the middle of the dorsum, as well as a rather strongly curved row of indistinct grey dots crossing the wing from the third costal spot. A brownish terminal line is marked with a series of dark fuscous dots. The hindwings are grey.
