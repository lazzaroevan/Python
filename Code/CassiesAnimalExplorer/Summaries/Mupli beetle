The Mupli beetle, Luprops tristis, is a plant detritus eating darkling beetle found in parts of India. The adult beetle is black and around 8 millimetres (0.31 in) long. While they are usually harmless to humans, when squeezed or picked up, they produce a defensive phenolic secretion that causes skin burns. Luprops beetles have a notorious reputation since they can make life difficult when large populations invade farm houses, as reported in some parts of southern India, especially the state of Kerala, where they are called മുപ്ലി വണ്ട് or കോട്ടെരുമ or കരിവണ്ട് in Malayalam. The name "Mupli beetle" comes from the region where the first major infestations of this beetle in Kerala were noted.
