Myrmecophytes (; literally "ant-plant") are plants that live in a mutualistic association with a colony of ants.  There are over 100 different genera of myrmecophytes.  These plants possess structural adaptations that provide ants with food and/or shelter.  These specialized structures include domatia, food bodies, and extrafloral nectaries.  In exchange for food and shelter, ants aid the myrmecophyte in pollination, seed dispersal, gathering of essential nutrients, and/or defense. Specifically, domatia adapted to ants may be called myrmecodomatia.
