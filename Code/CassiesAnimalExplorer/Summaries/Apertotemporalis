Apertotemporalis was a bothremydid turtle that lived during the Late Cretaceous. The type species A. baharijensis was named in 1934 by Ernst Stromer for a specimen, NR 1912 VIII 93, consisting only of a fragmentary skull destroyed during World War II. No more remains have been found since. The specimen was found in the Bahariya Formation of Egypt. It had a carapace length of 60 centimetres (24 in), making it the largest known known turtle discovered in the Bahariya Formation to date.
