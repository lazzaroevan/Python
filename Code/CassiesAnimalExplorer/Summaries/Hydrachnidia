Hydrachnidia, also known as "water mites", Hydrachnidiae, Hydracarina or Hydrachnellae, are among the most abundant and diverse groups of benthic arthropods, composed of 6,000 described species from 57 families.  As water mites of Africa, Asia, and South America have not been well-studied, the numbers are likely to be far greater. Other taxa of parasitengone mites include species with semi-aquatic habits, but only the Hydracarina are properly subaquatic.  Water mites follow the general parasitengona life cycle, which is characterized by parasitic, calyptostatic, and predaceous stages.  They are ubiquitous in nearly all freshwater habitats of every continent except Antarctica.  Typical habitats include streams and marshes, but may also be found in more obscure areas such as treeholes, hot springs, deep lakes and waterfalls.  Some species have also adapted to marine environments.  Water mites are unusual among freshwater invertebrates in being colorful, with brilliant reds and oranges being most obvious, but they also display more subtle blues, greens and yellows. They are also unusual among all mites in that some lineages have movable, internalized eye lenses sunk deep within the tissues of the prosoma rather than being set on the surface of the cuticle.
