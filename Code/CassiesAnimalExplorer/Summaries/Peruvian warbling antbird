The Peruvian warbling antbird (Hypocnemis peruviana) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It was considered a subspecies of Hypocnemis cantator, but based on vocal differences and to a lesser degree differences in plumages, it has been recommended that they be treated as separate species. As presently defined, the Peruvian warbling antbird includes a single subspecies, saturata. It has a black, white, and grey head and breast, with rufous flanks and a dull brown lower back and tail.
The Peruvian warbling antbird is found at lower levels in humid forest in south-eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern Bolivia and western Brazil. It is locally sympatric with the yellow-breasted warbling antbird.
