Silvertip tetra (Hasemania nana) is a species of characid freshwater fish native to streams and creeks in the SÃ£o Francisco basin in Brazil, but frequently kept in aquariums. Silvertip tetras are slightly more aggressive than other comparable smaller tetras, observed occasionally to nip other similarly sized tetras.
