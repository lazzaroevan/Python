The spot-throated hummingbird (Thaumasius taczanowskii) is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is found in northern Peru, with uncorroborated sightings from extreme south Ecuador.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.
This species was formerly placed in the genus Leucippus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that Leucippus was polyphyletic. To resolve the polyphyly the spot-throated hummingbird and the Tumbes hummingbird were moved to the resurrected genus Thaumasius.
