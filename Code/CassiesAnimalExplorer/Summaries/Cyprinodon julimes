The Julimes pupfish (Cyprinodon julimes) (Spanish: Cachorrito de Julimes) is a species of killifish in the family Cyprinodontidae. This pupfish is endemic to El Pandeño, a hot spring in Julimes, Chihuahua, Mexico, and it is adapted to life in water that reaches temperatures as high as 46 °C (114 °F). Consequently, it has been referred to as the "hottest fish in the world", although the closely related Cyprinodon pachycephalus can occur in somewhat warmer waters. Cyprinodon julimes was scientifically described in 2009 as similar to Cyprinodon eximius, but it has a bigger head, nearly one-third of its standard length.
