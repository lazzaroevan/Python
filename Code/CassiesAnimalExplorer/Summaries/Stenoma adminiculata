Stenoma adminiculata is a moth of the family Depressariidae. It is found in the Guianas.The wingspan is 24â€“26 mm. The forewings are pale violet brownish with the extreme costal edge ochreous white and with a nearly straight somewhat irregular dark fuscous line from one-fourth of the costa to the dorsum beyond the middle, with a small posterior projection in the middle (representing the first discal stigma). There is a slender fusiform dark fuscous mark along the costa in the middle and there are two cloudy dark fuscous dots transversely placed on the end of the cell. A semicircular dark fuscous spot is found on the costa at four-fifths, where a faint curved fuscous line runs to the dorsum before the tornus. There is also a terminal series of dark fuscous dots. The hindwings are light ochreous yellow.
