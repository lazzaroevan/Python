Conus anemone, common name the anemone cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
Conus anemone is a variable species or a species complex, as reflected by the large number of nominal species that have been established. In particular, C. peronianus, a very large form occurring from Port Lincoln, South Australia, to Cape Naturaliste, requires further taxonomic examination.
