Cornufer citrinospilus is a species of frog in the family Ceratobatrachidae. It is endemic to the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea, and is only known from the Nakanai Mountains of East New Britain Province. The specific name citrinospilus is derived from the Greek words kitrinos (="yellow") and pilos (="spot" or "stain"), in reference to the distinctive bright yellow flank areolations characteristic of this species.
