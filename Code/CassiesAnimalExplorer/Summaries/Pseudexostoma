Pseudexostoma is a genus of fish in the family Sisoridae endemic to China. These species are restricted to the upper Salween (Nujiang River) and one upper branch of the Irrawaddy (Dayinjiang River) in China. P. brachysoma is known only from the middle and lower Nujiang River. P. yunnanensis is only known from the upper Dayinjiang. These rivers were once connected, but are now separated. Also, the environment and temperature of the Nujiang River became greatly different between the northern and southern areas, leading to speciation.
