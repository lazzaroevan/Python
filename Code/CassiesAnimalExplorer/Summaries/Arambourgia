Arambourgia is an extinct genus of alligatorine crocodylian from Europe. It was named in 1905 and synonymized with Allognathosuchus haupti in 1990, but later reassigned as its own genus once again in 2004. It is thought to have been closely related to Hispanochampsa and Procaimanoidea. Arambourgia was likely to have been part of an early dispersal event of alligatorines from North America to Europe during the Eocene epoch. Arambourgia had non-serrated teeth and a deep orienirostral snout, unlike the flatter snouts of most other alligatorids.
