Phrynobatrachus ukingensis is a species of frog in the family Phrynobatrachidae. It is recorded in several places in southern and eastern Tanzania and in northern and southern Malawi (Ukinga and Rungwe mountains in the southern Tanzania and the Uluguru Mountains in the east; the Misuku Mountains and Nchenachena in northern Malawi, and Maroka in the highlands southwest of the Zomba Massif in southern Malawi); it probably occurs more widely, at least in areas in between the known localities. Common names Ukinga puddle frog and Ukinga river frog have been coined for it.
