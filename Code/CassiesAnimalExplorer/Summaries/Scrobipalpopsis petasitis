It is found in northern Europe, the Alps and on the Taimyr Peninsula.The wingspan is 15â€“20 mm.The larvae feed on Petasites albus, Petasites paradoxus and Petasites frigidus. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a large, full depth, inflated, brownish blotch, expanding from the leaf margin. A single mine generally contains three to ten larvae. The species overwinters in the larval stage, either in the mine or between spun parts of the leaf.
