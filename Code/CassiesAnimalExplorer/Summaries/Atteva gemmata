Atteva gemmata is a moth of the  family Attevidae. It was described by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1873 and is endemic to Cuba.
It is very similar to Atteva rawlinsi from Hispaniola but half its size. In Atteva gemmata the dots are reduced in number and connected to each other forming small, vertical, white lines.
