Dario hysginon is a tropical freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia; in the countries of India, Myanmar, and Bengal. Hysginon means scarlet or red dye in Ancient Greek which has been classified to this genus of Dario because of its red appearance. They can grow about 2–4 cm, and they have dorsal fins that contain 14 – 15 spines, and 5 – 7 soft rays. Dario hysginons are generally peaceful fish, and can live for 3 – 6 years. Sven O. Kullander and Ralf Britz have added many species of fish to FishBase and gave Dario hysginon a Swedish name, "Purpurbadis".
