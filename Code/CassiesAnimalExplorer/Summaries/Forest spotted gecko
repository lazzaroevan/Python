The forest spotted gecko or Erode ground gecko (Cyrtodactylus speciosus) is a species of gecko that is endemic to hills of South India, in parts of Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats. It was first described from hills near Erode in Tamil Nadu in 1870. Subsequently, this species was thought to be similar to Cyrtodactylus collegalensis, but recent studies have confirmed that they are distinct. This species has been sighted in hills around Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode, in parts of the Eastern Ghats in Tamil Nadu.
