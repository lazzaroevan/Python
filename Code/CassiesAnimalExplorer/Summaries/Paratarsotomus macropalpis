Paratarsotomus macropalpis is a species of mite belonging to the family Anystidae. The mite is endemic to Southern California and is usually observed darting amongst sidewalks and in rocky areas. Earlier classified as belonging to genus Tarsotomus, it was reclassified in 1999, along with four other species, to genus Paratarsotomus. It is quite small—0.7 mm—but has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length.
