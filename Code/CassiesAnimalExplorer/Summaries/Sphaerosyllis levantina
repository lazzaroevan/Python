Sphaerosyllis levantina is a species belonging to the phylum Annelida, a group known as the segmented worms. It was first described from Haifa Bay in the eastern Mediterranean. It is similar to Sphaerosyllis hystrix, and is thought to show a cosmopolitan distribution. Its name derives from its type locality (Levantine Basin), levantina being the feminine form of a neo-Latin adjective meaning "pertaining to the region where the sun raises"; the adjective is feminine to agree with the feminine genus name, Syllis being a river nymph in Greek mythology.While Faulwetter et al. researched the soft bottom benthos of Haifa Bay, several individuals of the Sphaerosyllis exhibited features which did not correspond to any known Sphaerosyllis species. These characteristics were: falcigers with prominent serration and with a subdistal spine present in all chaetigers; a subdistal spine on the blades of some of its falcigers (also found in S. hystrix and S. boeroi). The authors then re-examined material of Sphaerosyllis hystrix from previous finds, which revealed some individuals possessed a subdistal spine on the blades of anterior falcigers and also in posterior chaetigers. To clarify the relationship between the new specimens and the 2 described species possessing falcigers with a subdistal spine, the scientists conducted a morphometric analysis.
