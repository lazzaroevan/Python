Dorylinae is an ant subfamily, with distributions in both the Old World and New World. The Dorylinae evolved into existence around 74-101 million years ago. The Dorylinae also went through rapid adaptive radiation events during their early history. In 2014, Brady et al. synonymized the previous dorylomorph subfamilies (Aenictinae, Aenictogitoninae, Cerapachyinae, Ecitoninae, and Leptanilloidinae) under Dorylinae.
