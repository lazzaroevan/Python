The long-tongued arboreal mouse (Rhagomys longilingua) is a South American rodent species of the family Cricetidae. It is found in a variety of habitats, including dense forest, in Bolivia and Peru at elevations from 450 to 2,100 metres (1,480 to 6,890 ft) on the eastern side of the Andes. The species is at least partly arboreal. It is distinguished from the Brazilian arboreal mouse (R. rufescens), the only other known member of Rhagomys, by spiny fur and certain skull features such as the presence of beading in the interorbital region.
