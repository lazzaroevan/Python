The Daintree rainbowfish (Cairnsichthys bitaeniatus) is a species of rainbowfish endemic to Australia. This species is endemic to the wet tropics of north eastern Queensland where it has been recorded from the Cooper Creek and nearby Hutchinson Creek systems of the Daintree region of north-eastern Queensland. This species occurs in small clear, shady rainforest streams which flow over a substrate consisting of rock, sand, gravel and log debris. Within these streams the fishes swim near the surface to midwater depths and are frequently found in the deeper pools of these streams where there is a faster current. They will form mixed schools with blue-eyes and other rainbowfishes.
