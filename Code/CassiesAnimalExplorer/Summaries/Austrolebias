Austrolebias is a genus of killifish in the family Rivulidae. These annual killifish live in temporary pools, swamps and streams in the Río de la Plata, Patos–Mirim and Mamoré basins in South America.Most species are small, less than 10 cm (3.9 in) in total length, but a few reach 15–22 cm (5.9–8.7 in), making them some of the largest killifish (only a few Fundulus, Moema and Orestias reach a similar or larger size).
