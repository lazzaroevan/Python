Arctocyonians (Arctocyonia also known as "Procreodi") are a clade of laurasiatherian mammals whose stratigraphic range from the Palaeocene to the Early Eocene epochs.  They were among the earliest examples of major mammalian predators after the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. While some classify arctocyonians as stem-artiodactyls, others have classified the group as members of Ferae. There are three families classified in the order: Arctocyonidae, Oxyclaenidae, and Quettacyonidae.
