Pseudoeurycea nigromaculata, commonly known as the black-spotted salamander or black-spotted false brook salamander is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Veracruz, Mexico, and known from Cerro Chicahuaxtla (1,300–1,600 m (4,300–5,200 ft) asl)) in Cuatlalpan (the type locality, near Fortín de las Flores) and from Volcán San Martín at elevations of 1,200–1,300 m (3,900–4,300 ft). These separate populations likely represent distinct species.
