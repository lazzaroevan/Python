Pseudorupilia ruficollis aka as the Swollen Restio Beetle is a member of the Chrysomelidae family. Pseudorupilia (Jacoby, 1893) resembles the Australian genus Rupilia (Clark, 1864) whence its generic name. It is known only from South Africa and is strongly associated with the Cape fynbos, feeding on the pollen of Restionaceae, Proteaceae and Asteraceae.
