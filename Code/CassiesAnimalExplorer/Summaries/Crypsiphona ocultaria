Crypsiphona ocultaria (erroneously as: Phalaena occultaria Guen√©e, 1857) the red-lined looper moth or red-lined geometer, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Edward Donovan in 1805 and it is found in Australia.It is one of the most common moths found in Australia. The "red-lined" part of the name refers to the red markings seen on the undersides of the wings. As larvae they are green and feed on eucalypt leaves. When threatened the grub stands still, pretending to be a stick.
