Coleophora keireuki is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in Turkestan and Uzbekistan.
The larvae feed on the leaves of Caroxylon species, including Caroxylon orientalis. They create a leafy, tubular, straight case. It consists of two to three cylindrical pieces. No expansion of the case takes place. The surface is completely covered with leaf pubescence. The valve is three-sided. The length of the case is 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in), and it is yellow to chocolate-brown or brownish in color. Larvae can be found from May to the beginning of October. There are at least two generations per year.
