Stenoma adoratrix is a moth of the family Depressariidae. It is found in Bolivia.The wingspan is 25â€“28 mm. The forewings are light brownish ochreous or greyish ochreous, towards the costa and termen suffused whitish, the costal edge posteriorly ferruginous ochreous. There is an undefined patch of purple-brown suffusion occupying the median area of the dorsum and extending more than half across the wing. There is a round purplish spot indicating the second discal stigma and a rather thick irregular brown streak from the middle of the costa obliquely outwards to beyond this, and then rather sinuate to the dorsum at four-fifths, and a slender curved streak, tending to be broken into dots from the costa at three-fourths to the tornus, the discal veins between these streaks sometimes appearing darker shaded. There is a terminal series of small indistinct fuscous dots. The hindwings are pale ochreous yellow, towards the dorsum whitish tinged.
