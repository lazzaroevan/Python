Papurana daemeli is a species of "true frog", family Ranidae. It is found in New Guinea, northern Australia, and some smaller islands (Yapen, New Hanover Island, New Britain). It is the only ranid frog found in Australia. In Australia, the species is restricted to the rainforest of northern Queensland and the eastern border of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory. In Australia, it is usually known as wood frog (though in North America this would refer to Lithobates sylvaticus) or sometimes as water frog. Other vernacular names are Australian wood frog, Australian bullfrog, and Arnhem rana.
