Phyllobates bicolor, also known as the black-legged poison frog, bicolored dart frog or neari in Choco, is the second-most toxic of the wild poison dart frogs. This species obtained its name due to its normally yellow or orange body with black or dark blue hindlegs and forelimbs below the elbow. It lives in the lowland forests in the Choc√≥ area in western Colombia, along the San Juan River.
In this species, the male transports tadpoles adhering on its back.
