The silvery pigeon (Columba argentina), also known as silvery wood-pigeon or grey wood-pigeon is a species of pigeon found in Indonesia and Malaysia. It was thought to be extinct but wild populations rediscovered in 2008 near Masokut Island might represent this species, and photographs from Simeulue confirm its existence there.
