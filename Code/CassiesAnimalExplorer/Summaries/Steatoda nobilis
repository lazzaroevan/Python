Steatoda nobilis is a spider in the genus Steatoda, known in the United Kingdom as the noble false widow and is often referred to as the false widow. As the common name indicates, the spider superficially resembles and is frequently confused for the black widow and other spiders in the genus Latrodectus. S. nobilis has medically significant venom, where in England, it has a reputation as one of the few local spider species that is capable of inflicting a painful bite to humans, with most bites resulting in symptoms similar to a bee or wasp sting.S. nobilis is spotted all year round, both indoors and outdoors in a variety of habitats including cacti, roadside cuttings, and demolished buildings. They prey on both vertebrates and invertebrates using an "attack wrap" strategy where silk is wrapped around the victim.Steatoda nobilis is native to Madeira and the Canary Islands from where it allegedly spread to Europe, and continued to spread to other parts of the world including the United States, Chile, Columbia and other countries. They are one of the world's most invasive species of spider.
