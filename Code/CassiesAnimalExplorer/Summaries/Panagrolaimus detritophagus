Panagrolaimus detritophagus is a terrestrial free-living nematode (roundworm). It has been reported in California, South America and Europe. It is the type species of the genus Panagrolaimus. In 2018, it, along with another nematode species (Plectus parvus) became the first multicellular organism to be thawed back into a living state after prolonged cryopreservation. Pleistocene permafrost was obtained from the Kolyma River lowland, and thawed. The worms moved and ate after being thawed. They had been frozen for 30â€“40 thousand years, based on the age of that deposit.
