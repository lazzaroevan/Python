Species include:

Japanese pond turtle, M. japonica

M. mutica mutica
M. mutica kami
Vietnamese pond turtle or Annam leaf turtle, M. annamensis - formerly separated in Annamemys
Caspian turtle or striped-neck terrapin, M. caspica
M. caspica caspica
M. caspica siebenrocki
M. caspica vetrimaculata
Balkan pond turtle or Balkan terrapin, M. rivulata - formerly included in M. caspica
Spanish pond turtle, M. leprosa - formerly included in M. caspica
M. leprosa leprosa
M. leprosa saharica
Chinese broad-headed pond turtle, M. megalocephala
Red-necked pond turtle, M. nigricans
Chinese pond turtle, M. reevesii
Chinese stripe-necked turtle, M. sinensisThe Fujian pond turtle, described as Mauremys iversoni, is a farm-bred hybrid, between yellow pond turtles (usually females) and the golden coin turtle or Cuora cyclornata (usually males). Similarly, the turtles described as Mauremys pritchardi are farm-bred and wild-occurring hybrids between the Chinese pond turtle and the yellow pond turtle. While it is not unusual for valid species of geoemydid turtles to arise from hybrids, this is yet to be discussed with M. pritchardi; M. iversoni is probably not, since they only seem to be produced in farms and most males are sterile.
