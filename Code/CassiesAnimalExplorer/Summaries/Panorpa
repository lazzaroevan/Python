Panorpa is a genus of scorpion-flies that is widely dispersed, especially in the Northern hemisphere. However, they do not occur in western North America. Thirteen species occur in eastern Canada.About 260 species are described as of 2018.
Larvae and adults feed on carrion.The species P. vulgaris, has become a model insect for testing theories of sexual selection as its mating system has been noted to be similar to that of humans in some aspects. Studies show that both sexes of the species display mating preferences for direct (e.g. nuptial gifts) and indirect benefits (e.g. genetic benefits) to increase reproductive success. The production of nuptial gifts during copulation in males (e.g. salivary secretion) and high nutritional condition in females are indicators of "good foraging genes", an indirect benefit that individuals look for in their partners. These genetic benefits can increase fitness in offspring and improve their foraging ability.The life-cycle of Panorpa nuptialis and its habits, have become of interest in the field of forensic entomology.
