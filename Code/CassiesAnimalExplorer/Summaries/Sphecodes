Sphecodes is a genus of bees from the family Halictidae, the majority of which are black and red in colour and are colloquially known as "blood bees". Sphecodes bees are cleptoparasitic on other bees, especially bees in the genera Lasioglossum, Halictus and Andrena. The adults consume nectar, but because they use other bees' provisions to feed their offspring they do not collect pollen.
