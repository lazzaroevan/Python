The ashy flycatcher, blue-grey flycatcher or ashy alseonax (Muscicapa caerulescens) is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae. It is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, excluding the drier areas of South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia. It inhabits subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, and savanna. The species does not display sexual dimorphism, with both sexes being grey in colour with pale grey or white underparts. Different subspecies show minute differences in appearance.
The species has a disputed generic placement, with different authorities variously putting it in Muscicapa, Fraseria, and other genera. There are six recognised subspecies.
The species has a small, thin, and pointed beak adapted for eating insects. Its diet is mostly insectivorous, although it also eats berries and small geckoes. The birds are very active, foraging singly, in groups, or in mixed-species flocks. They forage in the upper levels of the canopy, with prey being caught with small circular flights, from foliage, and being gleaned from the bark and leaves. The species breeds in solitary pairs, with each pair maintaining a territory of 1-4 ha and raising young alone. A variety of vocalisations is used by the species, and there is very little geographical variation in calls.
