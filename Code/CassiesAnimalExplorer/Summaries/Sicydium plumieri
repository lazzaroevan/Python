Sicydium plumieri (Spanish vernacular: Olivo, Ceti; English vernacular: Sirajo Goby) is a freshwater species of the goby native to the Antilles from Cuba to Trinidad and Tobago, though not recorded from all islands.  This species can reach a length of 11 centimetres (4.3 in) TL. It is also known by the English common names sirajo, Plumier's stone-biting goby, and tri-tri goby. The young, which are regarded as a delicacy, are of commercial importance. The specific name honours Charles Plumier (1646-1704), a Franciscan friar and naturalist, who found the first specimens of the species on Martinique and Marcus Elieser Bloch based his species description on Plumier's drawings.
