Hulsanpes (meaning "Khulsan foot") is a genus of sawbill-like halszkaraptorine theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now the Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia, about 75-72 million years ago. The remains were found in 1970 and formally described in 1982 by Halszka Osm√≥lska noting that the genus is represented by an immature individual. Hulsanpes represents the first record from the relatively new erected group Halszkaraptorinae.
