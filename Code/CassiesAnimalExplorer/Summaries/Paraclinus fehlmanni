Paraclinus fehlmanni is a species of labrisomid blenny only known from the Pacific coast of Ecuador where it is found in tide pools down to depths of 2 metres (6.6 ft).  Males of this species can reach a length of 4 centimetres (1.6 in) SL while females can grow to 8.4 centimetres (3.3 in). The specific name honours the ichthyologist and herpetologist Herman Adair Fehlmann (1917-2005) who worked at the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center and who, among collecting many other specimens, collected the type of this species.
