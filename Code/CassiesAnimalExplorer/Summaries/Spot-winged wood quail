The spot-winged wood quail (Odontophorus capueira) is a species of bird in the family Odontophoridae. It is found in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, and formerly in Uruguay. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry lowland forests. Its population is thought to be declining but at a moderate rate, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being a "least-concern species".
