The wingspan is 7â€“8 mm. The posterior tarsi are whitish.Forewings are golden-orange ; a white median streak from base to
near middle; dorsum narrowly white towards base ; four costal and three dorsal shining white anteriorly blackish-margined wedge-shaped spots ; a black apical strigula, edged above with

The larvae feed on Prunus cerasifera, Prunus mahaleb and sometimes Prunus spinosa, as well as various cultivated Prunus species. Mines may also occur on Malus species when grown in proximity of cultived Prunus. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They create a lower-surface tentiform mine, usually between two side veins, without clear folds.
