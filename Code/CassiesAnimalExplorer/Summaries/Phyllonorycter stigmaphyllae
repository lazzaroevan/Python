Phyllonorycter stigmaphyllae is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Cuba.The larvae feed on Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a large, irregular blotch-mine on the upperside of the leaf, leaving the very thin upper epidermis semitransparent whitish, while the underside of the leaf shows no sign of the mine.
