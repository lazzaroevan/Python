Horaiclavidae  is a family of predatory sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Conoidea.In 2011 this family was split off from the family Pseudomelatomidae (formerly the subfamily Crassispirinae McLean, 1971) by Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. in their publication "A new operational classification of the Conoidea". It forms a clade together with the family Clavatulidae. It has many characters in common with the family Pseudomelatomidae, except the smaller shell with a low spire, the short siphonal canal and a weak or absent spiral sculpture.  The radular formula is 1-0-0-0-1, but some species in this family lack a radula.
