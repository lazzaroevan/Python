Pseudorthocerida is an order of generally straight longiconic Orthoceratoids with a subcentral to marginal cyrtochoanitic siphuncle composed of variably expanded segments which may contain internal deposits that may develop into a continuous parietal lining. (Sweet 1964). Cameral deposits are common and concentrated ventrally. Apices typically have a slight to moderate exogastric curvature
The Pseudorthocerida are included in a broad in-group of generally orthoconic cephalopods known as the Orthoceratoidea (Kroger 2008) along with the Ascocerida, Dissidocerida, Lituitida, and Orthocerida.
The Pseudorthocerida were among the last living orthoconic nautiloids.  One family, the Trematoceratidae, survived into the Triassic Period.
