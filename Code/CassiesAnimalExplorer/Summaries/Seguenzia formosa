Seguenzia formosa is a species of extremely small deep water sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Seguenziidae. The epithet "formosa" means "beautiful". 
It resembles Seguenzia monocingulata and has been regarded as a synonym of that (extinct) species. However the two species are distinct, based on shell morphology.
