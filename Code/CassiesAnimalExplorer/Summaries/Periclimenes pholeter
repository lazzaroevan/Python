Periclimenes pholeter, is a species of shrimp belonging to the family Palaemonidae. The species is closest to Periclimenes indicus, P. obscurus and P. toloensis, resembling these species in the presence of an epigastric tooth on the carapace, the shape of the abdomen, the spinulation of the carapace, and the unarmed fingers of the first chelipeds. P. pholeter most resembles P. indicus by the elongatecarpus and long fingers of the second pereiopods, differing in these features from P. toloensis, which has the fingers slightly less than half as long as the palm. In P. obscurus the fingers are shorter than the palm, but the carpus is about as long as the palm. From P. indicus, this species differs: by the greater size; by the much higher rostrum and the greater number of ventral rostral teeth; by the shorter eye; by the less slender antennular peduncle; by the more deeply cleft upper antennular flagellum; by the more robust scaphocerite; by the fingers of the first pereiopods (much longer than the palm); by the more slender pereiopods, especially the fifth, which is much longer than the ischium.
