Mantellinae is a subfamily of frogs in the family Mantellidae. These frogs are native to Madagascar and Mayotte. The species vary in size from under 25 mm (e.g. some species of Blommersia) to over 100 mm (e.g. Mantidactylus guttulatus). The subfamily is most famous for the genus Mantella, which contains species that superficially resemble poison dart frogs of the tropical Americas, and have converged on similar aposematic colouration and toxins. As of 2 May 2016, there are 128 described species in this subfamily, but several more are described each year.
