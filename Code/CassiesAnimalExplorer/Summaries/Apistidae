Apistidae, the wasp scorpionfishes, is a family of scorpaeniform fishes native to the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. They are fairly small fishes reaching lengths of 15 centimetres (5.9 in) TL in Cheroscorpaena tridactyla to 20 centimetres (7.9 in) TL in Apistus carinatus.A recent study placed the waspfishes into an expanded stonefish clade (Synanceiidae) because all of these fish have a lachrymal saber that can project a switch-blade-like mechanism out from underneath their eye.
