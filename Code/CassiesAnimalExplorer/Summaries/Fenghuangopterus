Fenghuangopterus is a genus of basal pterosaur that lived in northeastern China during the Middle Jurassic. 
The type species Fenghuangopterus lii was in 2010 described and named by LÃ¼ Junchang et al. The generic name is derived from the Fenghuang Mountain and a Latinized Ancient Greek pteron, "wing". The specific name honors Li Xiumei, who donated the fossil. It is known from a single relatively complete, though badly crushed, fossil skeleton, holotype CYGB-0037, recovered from the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province, about 160 million years old. Fenghuangopterus is a member of the rhamphorhynchid subfamily Scaphognathinae, which had previously been known only from the Late Jurassic and includes the close relatives Scaphognathus, Sordes and Harpactognathus.
