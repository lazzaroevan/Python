The horned sungem (Heliactin bilophus) is a South American hummingbird, the only species, (monotypic), of the genus Heliactin. The scientific name bilophus is sometimes considered a nomen oblitum, which, if accepted, results in Heliactin cornutus being the correct name for this species. It occurs in Bolivia, Brazil, and Suriname. It prefers fairly dry open or semi-open habitats, such as savanna and Cerrado. It avoids dense humid forest.
