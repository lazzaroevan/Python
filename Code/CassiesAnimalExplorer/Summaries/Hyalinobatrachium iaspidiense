Hyalinobatrachium iaspidiense (common name: Yuruani glass frog, in Spanish ranita de cristal de Jaspe) is a species of frog in the family Centrolenidae from South America. Its specific name refers Quebrada de Jaspe, its type locality.
There is some disagreement whether Hyalinobatrachium nouraguensis is a junior synonym of Hyalinobatrachium iaspidiense or not. Specifically, as of early 2016, the latest assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) treats Hyalinobatrachium nouraguensis as a valid species that is of "Least Concern".
