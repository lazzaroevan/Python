The Sierra Nevada red fox (Vulpes vulpes necator), also known as the High Sierra fox, is a subspecies of red fox and likely one of the most endangered mammals in North America.  The fox's Sierra Nevada Distinct Population Segment is estimated at 29 adults near Sonora Pass in California.  The Southern Cascades Distinct Population Segment consists of an estimated 42 adults near Lassen Volcanic National Park and an unknown number of individuals in five areas of Oregon.  No other populations are known.  Interbreeding with non-native red foxes and recruitment success are primary conservation concerns.The State of California banned trapping of Sierra Nevada red foxes in 1974 and listed the subspecies as threatened in 1980. The fox is a data gap species in Oregon and designated an Oregon sensitive species by the U.S. Forest Service. The Sierra Nevada Distinct Population Segment is listed as warranted but precluded under the Endangered Species Act.  Listing of the Southern Cascades Distinct Population Segment was found to be not warranted.
