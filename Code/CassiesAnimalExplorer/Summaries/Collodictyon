Collodictyon is a genus of single-celled eukaryotes belonging to the collodictyonids, also known as diphylleids.  Collodictyonids do not belong to any well-known kingdom-level grouping of that domain.  Recent research places them in a new 'supergroup' together with rigifilids and Mantamonas, with the so-far informal name 'CRuMs'.
