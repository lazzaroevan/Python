Paracimexomys is a genus of extinct mammals in the also extinct Multituberculata order. Paracimexomys lived during the Cretaceous period. The few fossils remains come from North America. Some Romanian fossils were also tentatively assigned to this genus, though that classification now seems doubtful.The genus Paracimexomys ("beside Cimexomys") was named by Archibald J.D. in 1982. Paracimexomys fossils were originally referred as Cimexomys, until it was realized they were different enough to justify a genus of their own.
