For the common gull butterfly, see Cepora nerissa.

The common gull, mew gull, or sea mew (Larus canus) is a medium-sized gull that breeds in the Palearctic, northern Europe, and northwestern North America. The names "common gull" and "mew gull" may also be used to refer to specifically the European and North American subspecies respectively. Many common gulls migrate further south in winter. There are differing accounts as to how the species acquired its vernacular name (see Etymology section below).
The name "sea mew" is a calque of the Dutch name "zee meeuw"
