The Comoran fish scale gecko (Geckolepis humbloti) is a species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. It is endemic to Grande Comore in the Comoros. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of Geckolepis maculata, however Hawlitschek et al. (2015) resurrected humbloti when it was determined to be paraphyletic based on DNA data.
