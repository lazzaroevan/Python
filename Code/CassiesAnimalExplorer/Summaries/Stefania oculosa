Stefania oculosa (common name in Spanish: rana stefania de ojos grandes) is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae. It is endemic to the Bolívar state of southern Venezuela and only known from Cerro Jaua, a tepui; it possibly occurs more widely. It was found on rocks in a fast-flowing cascading stream where it co-occurred with Stefania percristata. The known range is within the Jaua-Sarisariñama National Park, and the species is not facing known threats.
