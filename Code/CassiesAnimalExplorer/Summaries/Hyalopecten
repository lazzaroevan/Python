Hyalopecten is a genus of marine bivalve molluscs.
The placement of the genus Hyalopecten is currently uncertain. Habe included Hyalopecten within the subfamily Camptonectinae. However, Hyalopecten lacks antimarginal microsculpture, which is a key characteristic of Camptonectinae. Some authors consider Ciclopecten Seguenza, 1877 to be a senior synonym, however Ciclopecten has antimarginal microsculpture.
