Corythoichthys conspicillatus, the reticulate pipefish, is a species of pipefish from the family Syngnathidae which is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea to French Polynesia. It has reddish to reddish-brown and yellow bands on its body which have a reticulated pattern of lines superimposed on them, there are red spots on the snout, and the tail is pink to reddish with a white margin. The males have a bluish-black blotch around their anus which becomes more intense in colour during courtship. They grow to a total length of 180 millimetres (7.1 in). It can be found in seagrass beds or in sandy and rubble areas on sheltered reefs at depths of 1–25 metres (3.3–82.0 ft). It is normally seen in pairs or small groups.This species is often confused with Corythoichthys flavofasciatus and the two were considered conspecific by some authorities but it is now widely accepted as a valid species with C. flavofasciatus being restricted to the Red Sea.
