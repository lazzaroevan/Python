Aphanius transgrediens, the Acı Göl toothcarp or Acipinar killifish, is a species of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinodontidae. It is endemic to the springs of Lake Acıgöl in Turkey. It is threatened by a reduction in rainfall from climate change, and the abstraction of water from the springs. The introduction of the non-native eastern mosquitofish also threatens this species.
