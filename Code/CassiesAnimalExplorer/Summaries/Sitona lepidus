Sitona lepidus or clover root weevil is a species of weevil found in Europe. It has now spread to North America and New Zealand.
S. lepidus was found in New Zealand pastures in 1996 and poses a threat to farm productivity since it damages the clover plant. The use of the parasitic wasp Microctonus aethiopoides as a biological control is under way in Southland, New Zealand.
