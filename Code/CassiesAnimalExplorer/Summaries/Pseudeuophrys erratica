Pseudeuophrys erratica is a species of jumping spider (family Salticidae) that is distributed throughout Europe, although it is not common. P. erratica is normally found under the bark of trees or under rocks on forest fringes. The very similar looking P. lanigera is much more abundant, and is almost only found in or near buildings.
