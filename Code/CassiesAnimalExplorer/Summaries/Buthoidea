Buthoidea is the largest superfamily of scorpions. Its members are known as fat-tailed scorpions and bark scorpions. A few very large genera (Ananteris, Centruroides, Compsobuthus, or Tityus) are known, but a high number of species-poor or monotypic ones also exist. They occur in the warmer parts of every major landmass on Earth, except on New Zealand. The superfamily was established by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1837.
