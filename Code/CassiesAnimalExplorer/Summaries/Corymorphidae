Corymorphidae is a family of hydroid cnidarians. For long placed in a presumed superfamily or infraorder Tubulariida of suborder Capitata, they are actually close relatives of the Hydridae and are now united with these and a number of relatives in a newly recognized suborder Aplanulata. Most, if not all species in this family grow on stalks and resemble small flowers.
