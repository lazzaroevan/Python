She has worked with brands such as Ralph Lauren, Dior, Chanel, TAG Heuer, Net-a-Porter, and Tory Burch. She is also the face of Riva Fashion. Her fashion and style are mainly for women who dress modestly.
On 10 July 2018, Al Faraj uploaded a video on YouTube discussing her views on modesty and faith saying that she doesn't consider herself a hijabi and it would be "disrespectful" to call herself a hijabi. "I do not consider myself to be a hijabi because I don’t feel that it is in line with the viewpoint that I have now approaching 30. It’s not the viewpoint that I think is representative of me as a person. ... I consider myself in the modest fashion space".
