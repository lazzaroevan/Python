Mucronalia is a genus of very small parasitic sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks or micromollusks in the family Eulimidae.This genus was first described in 1860 by Arthur Adams in his paper, "On some new genera and species of Mollusca from Japan".These sea snails are thought to be parasitic on ophiuroids (brittle stars).
