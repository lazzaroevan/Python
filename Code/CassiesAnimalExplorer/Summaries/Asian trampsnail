The Asian trampsnail (Bradybaena similaris) is a species of small, invasive land snail. It is a pulmonate gastropod terrestrial mollusc in the family Bradybaenidae. It earned the common name based on its origins, and its habit of roosting on freight containers. This habit means that this may be one of the most broadly-distributed species of terrestrial snail in the world. Bradybaena similaris is the type species of the genus Bradybaena.
