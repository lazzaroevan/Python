An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. The word auk  is derived from Icelandic álka, from Old Norse alka (“auk”), from Proto-Germanic *alkǭ (“sea-bird, auk”).Apart from the extinct great auk, all auks can "fly" under water as well as in the air. Although they are excellent swimmers and divers, their walking appears clumsy.
Several species have different common names in Europe and North America. The guillemots of Europe are referred to as murres in North America, if they occur in both continents, and the little auk is referred to as the dovekie.
