Loncosaurus (meaning uncertain; either Araucanian "chief" or Greek "lance" "lizard") was a highly dubious genus of ornithopod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Provincia de Santa Cruz, Argentina.  The type (and only known) species is Loncosaurus argentinus, described by the famous Argentinian paleontologist Florentino Ameghino, but is considered a dubious name.  Details on this animal are often contradictory, befitting a genus that was long confused for a theropod.
Teeth attributed to cf. "Carnosaurus" may have actually belonged to Loncosaurus.
