Arripis trutta, known as kahawai in New Zealand and as the Australian salmon in Australia, is one of four species of marine fish within the genus Arripis, found in cooler waters around the south eastern and south western coasts of Australia and the New Zealand coastline.  Although it is referred to as a salmon in Australia and its species epithet trutta is the Latin for trout, it is not related to salmons or trouts of the family Salmonidae. Other common names for this species include Eastern Australian salmon, bay trout, black back, blackback salmon, buck, buck salmon, cocky salmon, colonial salmon, newfish, and salmon trout.
