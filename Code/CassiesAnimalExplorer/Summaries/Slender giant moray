The slender giant moray or Gangetic moray, Strophidon sathete, is the longest member of the family of moray eels. The longest recorded specimen was caught in 1927, on the Maroochy River in Queensland; it measured 3.94 metres. This species is characterized by an elongated body, as well as brownish-grey dorsal coloration which pales towards the venter.
