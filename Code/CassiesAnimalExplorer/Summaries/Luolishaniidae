The Luolishaniidae or Luolishaniida are a group of lobopodians with setiferous forelimbs known from the Cambrian period. The presence of thorn-shaped sclerites arranged as three per segment is diagnostic. The type genus is based on Luolishania longicruris Hou and Chen, 1989, from the Chengjiang Lagerstatte, South China. They are presumed to have been filter feeders. New specimens of the previously enigmatic Facivermis show that it was a sessile tube-dweller, and part of this group.
