Cornufer boulengeri, commonly known as Boulenger's wrinkled ground frog or Boulenger's platymantis, is a species of frog in the family Ceratobatrachidae. It is endemic to New Britain Island in the Bismarck Archipelago, Papua New Guinea.
The adults live on the forest floor of lowland and foothill rain forests, whereas juveniles occur low on the vegetation. It is potentially threatened by habitat loss caused by logging.
