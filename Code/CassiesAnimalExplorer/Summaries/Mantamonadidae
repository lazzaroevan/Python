The Mantamonadidae are of free-living heterotrophic flagellates that move primarily by gliding on surfaces (rather than swimming).  There is one genus, Mantamonas.  It has been suggested previously that the Mantamonadidae be classified in Apusozoa as sister of the Apusmonadida on the basis of rRNA analyses. However, mantamonads are currently placed in CRuMs on the basis of phylogenomic analyses that identify their closest relatives as the collodictyonids (=diphylleids) and Rigifila.
