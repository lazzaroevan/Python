The Stenopodidea or boxer shrimps are a small group of decapod crustaceans. Often confused with shrimp or prawns, they are neither, but belong in a group closer to the reptant decapods, such as lobsters and crabs. They can be easily recognized by their third pereiopod, which is greatly enlarged, while for lobsters and crabs, it is the first pereiopod that is much bigger than the others. There are 71 extant species currently recognized, divided into 12 genera. Three fossil species are also recognized, each belonging to a separate genus. The earliest fossil assigned to the Stenopodidea is Devonostenopus pennsylvaniensis from the Devonian. Until D. pennsylvaniensis was discovered, the oldest known member of the group was Jilinicaris chinensis from the Late Cretaceous.
