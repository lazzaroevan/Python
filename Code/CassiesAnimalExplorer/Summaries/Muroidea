The Muroidea are a large superfamily of rodents, including mice, rats, voles, hamsters, gerbils, and many other relatives.  They occupy a vast variety of habitats on every continent except Antarctica.  Some authorities have placed all members of this group into a single family, Muridae, due to difficulties in determining how the subfamilies are related to one another.  The following taxonomy is based on recent well-supported molecular phylogenies.The muroids are classified in six families, 19 subfamilies, around 280 genera, and at least 1750 species.
