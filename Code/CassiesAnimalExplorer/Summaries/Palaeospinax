Palaeospinax is an extinct genus of shark which lived from the Early Triassic to the end of the Eocene epoch. Although several species have been described, the genus is considered nomen dubium because the type-specimen of the type species, Paleospinax priscus, lacks appropriate diagnostic characters to define the genus.Other species originally described as Synechodus were transferred to the genus Palidiplospinax.
