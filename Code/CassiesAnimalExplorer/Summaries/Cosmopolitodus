Cosmopolitodus is an extinct genus of sharks. Its only species is currently Cosmopolitodus hastalis, the broad-tooth mako (other common names include the extinct giant mako and broad-tooth white shark). It is an extinct mackerel shark that lived between thirty to one million years ago during the Oligocene to the Early Pleistocene epochs.  Its teeth can reach lengths up to 3.5 in (7.5 cm) and are found worldwide. It is believed to be an ancestor to the great white shark, a fact supported by the transitional species Carcharodon hubbelli, and most likely would have been one of the major predators in its ecosystem; preying upon small whales and other mammals.
