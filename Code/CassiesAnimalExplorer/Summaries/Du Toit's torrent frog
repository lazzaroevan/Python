Du Toit's torrent frog, the Mt. Elgon torrent frog, or the Kenya rocky river frog (Arthroleptides dutoiti) is a species of frog in the family Petropedetidae endemic to Mount Elgon in Kenya; it has not been found on the Ugandan part of the mountain. It is one of many, often taxonomically unrelated, frogs referred to as torrent frogs.
The species was found by Cornelius Albertus du Toit, who collected the frog holotype in 1934. Dr. du Toit was a member of the Cape Town University, a founder member of the Zoological Society of South Africa, and Professor of Zoology at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. He wrote Zoological research in South Africa in 1961.
