Phyllonorycter caryaealbella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Georgia, Kentucky, Wisconsin and Florida in the United States.The wingspan is about 5 mm.
The larvae feed on Carya illinoinensis and Carya ovata. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a tentiform mine on the underside of the leaf. The parenchyma is eaten off of the upper cuticle in a ring, leaving a green spot in the centre, which is then eaten off. The pupa is contained in an oval cocoon made of frass.
