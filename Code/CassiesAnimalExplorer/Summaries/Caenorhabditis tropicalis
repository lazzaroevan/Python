Caenorhabditis tropicalis - prior to 2014 referred to as C. sp. 11, is a species of Caenorhabditis nematodes.
Similar to C. elegans and C. briggsae, C. tropicalis populations are made up of XX protandrous hermaphrodites and X0 males (androdioecy). These three species are not each other's closest relatives, but C. tropicalis groups in phylogenetic trees with the other two, and even more closely to C. wallacei, in the 'Elegans' supergroup. The hermaphroditic reproductive strategy of these species is an example of convergent evolution. Its genome was assembled at Genome Institute, Washington University.
