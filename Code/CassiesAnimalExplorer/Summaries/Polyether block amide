Polyether block amide or PEBA is a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). It is known under the tradename of PEBAX® (Arkema) and VESTAMID®  E (Evonik Industries). It is a block copolymer obtained by polycondensation of a carboxylic acid polyamide (PA6, PA11, PA12) with an alcohol termination polyether (Polytetramethylene glycol PTMG), PEG). The general chemical structure is:

HO - (CO - PA - CO - O - PE - O)n - HPEBA is a high performance thermoplastic elastomer. It is used to replace common elastomers – thermoplastic polyurethanes, polyester elastomers, and silicones - for these characteristics: lower density among TPE, superior mechanical and dynamic properties (flexibility, impact resistance, energy return, fatigue resistance) and keeping these properties at low temperature (lower than -40 °C), and good resistance against a wide range of chemicals. It is sensitive to UV degradation, however.
