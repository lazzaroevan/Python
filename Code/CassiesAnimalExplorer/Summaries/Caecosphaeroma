Caecosphaeroma is a troglodytic isopod genus in the family Sphaeromatidae found in caves of NE and SW France. The genus was split off from Monolistra by Adrien Dollfus in 1896; in both genera, the female carries about 10 fertilized eggs in its external marsupium (brood pouch); they are white in Monolistra but bluish-green in Caecosphaeroma. C. burgundum is the most studied species.
