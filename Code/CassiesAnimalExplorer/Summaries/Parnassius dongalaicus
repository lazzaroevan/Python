Parnassius dongalaicus, the Tytler's Apollo, is a high-altitude butterfly which is found in China.
It is a member of the snow Apollo genus (Parnassius) of the swallowtail family (Papilionidae).
P. dongalaicus was originally described as a species, but was subsequently considered conspecific with Parnassius epaphus. Sorimachi (1995) and Sugisawa (1996) both regard P. dongalaicus as a good species sympatric with epaphus and as the senior synonym of rikihiroi Kawasaki, 1995.
