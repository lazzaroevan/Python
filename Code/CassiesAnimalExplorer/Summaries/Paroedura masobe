Paroedura masobe is an endangered species of reptile. This species is endemic to Madagascar, where it is known from low elevation sites in the north of the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor. The extent of occurrence is currently 410 km2 (160 sq mi), however, due to the scarcity of suitable habitat between the known sites its true distributional extent within this area is likely to be below 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi). It occurs from 300 to 600 metres (980 to 1,970 ft). The animal likes the habitats in low elevation and humid forests.
