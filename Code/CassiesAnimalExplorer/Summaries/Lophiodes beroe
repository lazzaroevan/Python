Lophiodes beroe is a deep water dwelling fish that is elusive and does not have many remarkable traits. There is no common name for this fish yet.
L. beroe can be found on dead coral rubble, Lophelia pertusa, deep in the ocean and is often just resting and not swimming, which makes this a lie in wait predator. There are no threats that have been found at this time but further research is needed to fully understand this species.
