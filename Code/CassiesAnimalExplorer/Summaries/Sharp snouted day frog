The sharp snouted day frog (Taudactylus acutirostris), or sharp-nosed torrent frog, is a species of frog in the family Myobatrachidae. It is endemic to upland rainforest streams in north-eastern Queensland in Australia.
It was a diurnal, conspicuous and locally abundant species, but a rapid population decline began in 1988. It is therefore considered critically endangered under the IUCN Red List, and endangered under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, but is likely extinct, with the last known record in 1997, and is accordingly listed as such under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The primary cause for its rapid decline is believed to be the disease chytridiomycosis.
