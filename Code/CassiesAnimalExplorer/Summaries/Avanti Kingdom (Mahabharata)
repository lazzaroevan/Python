The historical Avanti Kingdom of ancient India is described in the Mahabharata epic.
Avanti was divided into north and south by river Vetravati. Initially, Mahissati  (Sanskrit Mahishamati)  was the capital of  Southern Avanti, and Ujjaini (Sanskrit Ujjayini) was of northern Avanti,  but at the  times of Mahavira and  Buddha,  Ujjaini was the capital of  integrated Avanti.  The country of Avanti roughly corresponded to modern Malwa, Nimar and adjoining parts of the Madhya Pradesh.
Both Mahishmati and Ujjaini stood on the southern high road called  Dakshinapatha extending from Rajagriha to Pratishthana (modern Paithan).  Avanti was an important center of Buddhism and some of the leading theras and theris were born and resided there.  King Nandivardhana of Avanti was defeated by king Shishunaga of Magadha. Avanti later became part of Magadhan empire.
