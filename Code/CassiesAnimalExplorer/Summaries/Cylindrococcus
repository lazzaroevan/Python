Cylindrococcus is a genus of scale insects that induces galls on plants of the genus Allocasuarina.  There are two described species of Cylindrococcus, both of which occur only in Australia.  The galls of adult females (10â€“30 mm long) look somewhat similar to the cone-like "fruit" of the host plant and might be mistaken for such.
