Macropoma (from Greek   μακρός "large" + πόμα "cover", after its large operculum) is an extinct genus of coelacanth in the class Sarcopterygii. These fish have been extinct for over 70 million years and are most closely related to the modern coelacanth Latimeria.
Fossils of Macropoma have been found in both England and Czech republic. Recorded fossils have bodies under two feet in length. A modern coelacanth measures five or more, but in other respects the two genera are remarkably similar, and share the same body plan with a three-lobed tail and stalked fins.Macropoma grew to a length of 22 inches (55 centimeters) and would have preyed upon smaller aquatic species.
