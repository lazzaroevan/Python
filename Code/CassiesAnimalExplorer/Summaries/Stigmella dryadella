Stigmella dryadella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found from Fennoscandia and northern Russia to the Pyrenees and Italy, and from Ireland to Romania.
The wingspan is 4.5-5.5 mm.
The larvae feed on Dryas octopetala. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a narrow corridor, descending towards the base of the leaf while following the leaf margin. Later, the corridor reverses its direction, and widens into a blotch that may occupy half of the leaf. The frass is concentrated in the corridor as a broad central ribbon and is broadly scattered in the blotch.
