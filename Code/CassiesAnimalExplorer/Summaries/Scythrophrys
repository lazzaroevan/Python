Scythrophrys is a genus of frogs in the family Leptodactylidae. It is monotypic, being represented by the single species, Scythrophrys sawayae, commonly known as the Banhado frog, after its type locality. It is endemic to Serra do Mar in Paran√° and Santa Catarina states, south-eastern Brazil. Its natural habitats are secondary and old growth forests; reproduction takes place in temporary pools. Its populations are scattered but it is locally common. It is threatened by habitat loss. This species was first described in 1953 by the American herpetologist Doris Mable Cochran whose research was focused on the herpetofauna of the West Indies and South America.
