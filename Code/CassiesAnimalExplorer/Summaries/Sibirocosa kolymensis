Sibirocosa kolymensis is a species of wolf spider found in the Kolyma region in the far east of Russia.
This species has a body length of up to 7 mm. It is rather variable in colour, from brown to almost black. There are few external distinguishing marks (apart from a reddish heart-shaped mark on the abdomen of the male) and it can only be distinguished with certainty from related species by details of the genitalia.
