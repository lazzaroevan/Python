Cyprichromis leptosoma is a mouthbrooding species of fish in the family Cichlidae. It is endemic to Lake Tanganyika in Zambia and Tanzania. It seems quite common within its range and faces no particular threats, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern.
