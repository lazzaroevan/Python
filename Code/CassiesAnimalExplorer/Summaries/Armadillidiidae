Armadillidiidae is a family of woodlice, a terrestrial crustacean group in the order Isopoda. Unlike members of other woodlice families, members of this family can roll into a ball, an ability they share with the outwardly similar but unrelated pill millipedes and other animals. This ability  gives woodlice in this family their common names of pill bugs or roly polies. Other common names include slaters  and doodle bugs. The best known species in the family is Armadillidium vulgare, the common pill bug. Pill bugs are native to Europe, wherefrom they were introduced to the Americas.
