Macrosaccus morrisella (hog peanut moth) is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. In North America it is known from Manitoba and Ontario south and west to Texas and Colorado.
The wingspan is 6â€“7 mm.
The larvae feed on Amphicarpaea bracteata and Strophostyles leiosperma. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine begins as an elongate serpentine track on the underside of the leaflet. This enlarges to an elongate-oval, whitish blotch which eventually becomes strongly tentiform.
