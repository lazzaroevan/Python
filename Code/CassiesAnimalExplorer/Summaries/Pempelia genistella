Pempelia genistella, the gorse colonial hard shoot moth, is a moth of the family Pyralidae. It is native to south-western Europe and north-western Africa, but has been introduced as a biological control agent for gorse in New Zealand and Hawaii.
The wingspan is 26â€“29 mm. Adults are on wing in July in western Europe.
The larvae feed on the needles of Ulex europaeus in which they spin a dense, conspicuous silken communal web.
