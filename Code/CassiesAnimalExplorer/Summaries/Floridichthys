Floridichthys is a genus of pupfishes native to the southeastern United States, Mexico and northern Central America. The name of this genus is a compound of Florida and the Greek for "fish", ichthys. The ichthyologist Carl Leavitt Hubbs thought that the genus was confined to Florida at the time he coined the name.
