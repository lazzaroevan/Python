Pseudoctomeris sulcatus is a species of barnacle, the only member of the genus Pseudoctomeris. It  has an eight-plated shell wall with the rostrum partially fused with adjacent rostrolatera. The suture lines are visible only from the inside, thus in exterior view, the shell appears to have six wall plates. The basis is calcareous. Opercular plates are higher than wide, and not deeply articulated. These features and others, show greater relationship to family Pachylasmatidae. Taxonomic revision of Pachylasmatidae may warrant transfer of Pseudoctomeris to that family.Diagnostic soft part characteristics, as described in Poltarukha, 2006 include a tridentate mandible and presence of a multi-jointed caudal appendage.
As Pseudoctomeris is monotypic, the genus characters are necessarily the same as those of P. sulcatus.
