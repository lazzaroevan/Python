Dragon Scroll (ドラゴンスクロール 甦りし魔竜, lit. "The Rebirth of the Evil Dragon") is a 1987 video game that was released exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer.
The game is non-linear and operates almost like a sandbox game. Many video games helped to influence this video game, including The Legend of Zelda. A large video game world helps to define the complexity of the gameplay. However, most puzzles are impossible for non-Japanese speakers to solve, but a fan-made translation patch has been made available by King Mike Translations in 2008.
