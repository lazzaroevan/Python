Pedaeosaurus is an extinct genus of therocephalian therapsids. Fossils have been found from the Fremouw Formation in the southern Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica. Pedaeosaurus has traditionally been classified as a scaloposaurid and more recently as an ericiolacertid closely related to Ericiolacerta (also from the Fremouw Formation).
