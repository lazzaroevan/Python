Cyrestis is a butterfly genus in the family Nymphalidae. They are known as map butterflies, so named because the wing-markings of some species resemble the lines of latitude and longitude of a world map. Cyrestis is a widespread genus ranging from Africa to parts of the Indomalayan realm and parts of the Australasian realm (New Guinea).
