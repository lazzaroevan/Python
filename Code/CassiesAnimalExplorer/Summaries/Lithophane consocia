It is found throughout northern, central and eastern Europe, east to Siberia. There is a single record from Great Britain, where it was recorded in Hampstead, London, in September 2001.

or less overlaid with purplish brown; the pale patch at base of costa, and the pale rings of the stigmata distinguish it at once from furcifera; all the markings, both lines and stigmata, are more conspicuous: grisea Graes.
