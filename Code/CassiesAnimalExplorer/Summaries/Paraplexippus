Paraplexippus is a genus of Caribbean jumping spiders that was first described by P. Franganillo B. in 1930. As of August 2019 it contains only two species, found only on the Greater Antilles: P. quadrisignatus and P. sexsignatus. The name is a combination of the Ancient Greek "para" (παρά), meaning "alongside", and the salticid genus Plexippus.
