The fuscous honeyeater (Ptilotula fusca) is a species of bird in the family Meliphagidae.
It is endemic to eastern Australia. The honeyeater mostly appears in different shades of grey, green and yellow.
Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.
The fuscous honeyeater was previously placed in the genus Lichenostomus, but was moved to Ptilotula after a molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2011, showed that the original genus was polyphyletic.
