Dynamosuchus is an extinct genus of pseudosuchian archosaurs from the family Ornithosuchidae. It is known from a single species, Dynamosuchus collisensis, which is based on a partial skeleton from the Santa Maria Formation of Brazil. Dynamosuchus is considered a close relative of Venaticosuchus, which is known from the Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina. Ornithosuchids are one of many groups which lived in the Santa Maria and Ischigualasto Formations, which formed at approximately the same time (the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic) and were ecologically similar. As a large scavenging reptile, Dynamosuchus helps to illuminate the trophic structure of the Santa Maria Formation. It also supports the hypothesis that ornithosuchids had diversified throughout South America by the start of the Carnian, and were not originally endemic to the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni√≥n Basin.
