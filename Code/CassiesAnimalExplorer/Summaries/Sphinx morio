Sphinx morio, the larch hawk moth or Asian pine hawkmoth, is a moth of the family Sphingidae. It is found in Russia, the Korean Peninsula, Japan and China.
The wingspan is 60â€“80 mm.
The larvae feed on Picea (including Picea asperata and Picea jezoensis), Larix (including Larix kaempferi, Larix sibirica, Larix olgensis var. koreana and Larix gmelinii), Pinus (including Pinus sibirica, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus koraiensis, Pinus densiflora, Pinus thunbergii and Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) and Abies species (including Abies fabri). In the Altai, it can be a major pest of Pinus sylvestris, sometimes causing complete defoliation of large areas.
