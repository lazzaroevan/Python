Mycalesis, the bushbrowns, are a genus of brush-footed butterflies. They are common in the warm regions from Central Asia to Australia, and have a high diversity in South Asia and the Wallacea.
They are notably polymorphic, with wet- and dry-season forms differing in many species, especially as regards size and number of underwing eyespots.
Mycalesis superficially resemble the species Orsotriaena medus, but can readily be identified by the number of spots.
