Urobatis maculatus, also known as the spotted round ray or Cortez round stingray, is a species of round ray endemic to Mexico. Its natural habitats are shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, coral reefs, estuarine waters, intertidal marshes, and coastal saline lagoons. This species reaches a length of 42 centimetres (17 in) TL. This species is placed in the genus Urobatis and the family Urotrygonidae.
The spotted round ray can be parasitized by the flatworm Pleorchis magniporus.The spotted round ray is ideal for captivity due to its hardiness and smaller size, and its is also a favorable candidate for breeding in aquaria. It can be kept in a minimum 180 gallon aquarium with fine substrate, little d√©cor, a bottom with much surface area (for sufficient swimming space), excellent filtration, protected internal tank equipment like heaters and filter intakes (by surrounding them with polyurethane foam barriers), and a secure lid. In the aquarium trade, it may be confused with the Round stingray, Urobatis halleri, which may be called the Cortez ray in the hobby as well.
