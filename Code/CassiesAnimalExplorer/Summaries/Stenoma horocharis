Stenoma horocharis is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1930. It is found in Pará, Brazil.The wingspan is 17–19 mm. The forewings are pinky whitish, with the costal and terminal edge pale rosy and with a blackish dot in the middle of the base, three (subcostal, median, subdorsal) in a curved series near the base, one beneath the costa at one-fourth and one obliquely beyond this, and three representing the stigmata (the plical obliquely beyond the first discal). There are two strongly and irregularly curved series of ill-defined blackish-grey dots or scattered scales, the first from before the middle of the costa passing beyond the cell to the dorsum beyond the middle, the second from three-fifths or two-thirds of the costa to the dorsum before the tornus. There is a marginal series of black dots around the apical part of the costa and termen. The hindwings are pale whitish yellowish.
