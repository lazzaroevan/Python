Diglossa is a genus in the family Thraupidae. They are commonly known as flowerpiercers because of their habit of piercing the base of flowers to access nectar that otherwise would be out of reach. This is done with their highly modified bill. Most members of the genus Diglossa are found in highlands of South America (especially the Andes), but two species are found in Central America.
