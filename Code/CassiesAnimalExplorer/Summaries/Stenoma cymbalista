The forewings are grey whitish, very faintly violet tinged and with the extreme costal edge white. The markings are dark grey. The first discal stigma forms a large round spot, others are dot like, the plical very obliquely beyond the first discal and there is a triangular spot on the middle of the costa, where a strongly excurved shade of irroration runs to a cloudy patch on the middle of the dorsum. There is also a large triangular spot on the costa at four-fifths, where a curved series of dots runs to the dorsum before the tornus. A marginal series of ten elongate dots is found around the apex and termen. The hindwings are ochreous whitish, with the apical edge greyish tinged.
