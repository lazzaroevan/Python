Paretroplus tsimoly is a species of cichlid fish from the Betsiboka River basin in northwestern Madagascar. Like other members of the lamena group, it is a rheophile (although less so than Oxylapia polli). This relatively elongate Paretroplus reaches about 16 centimetres (6.3 in) in length, and is closely related to P. lamenabe and P. nourissati.
