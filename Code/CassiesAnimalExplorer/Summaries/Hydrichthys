Hydrichthys is a genus of colonial marine hydrozoans formerly placed in the family Hydrichthyidae but is now included in the family Pandeidae. The polyps of members of this genus are parasitic. The polyp attaches itself to a fish, and in one species exhibits hyperparasitism by attaching itself to a copepod, itself the parasite of a fish.
