Comodica is a small genus of the fungus moth family, Tineidae. Therein, it belongs to the subfamily Erechthiinae. It is apparently a close relative of the type genus of its subfamily, Erechthias.It is usually delimited sensu stricto, making it a smallish genus, with 11 species presently placed here:
Comodica cirrhopolia (Turner, 1923)
Comodica coarctata (J.F.G.Clarke, 1971)
Comodica crypsicroca Turner, 1923
Comodica drepanosema Turner, 1923
Comodica lucinda Meyrick, 1927
Comodica ordinata Walsingham, 1914
Comodica polygrapta Meyrick, 1924 
Comodica semiades Bradley, 1956
Comodica signata J.F.G.Clarke, 1986
Comodica tetracercella Meyrick, 1880
Comodica tigrina Turner, 1917Erechthias and Comodica are not unequivocally delimited against each other yet. Some species of the former are occasionally placed in the present genus, namely:
Erechthias citrinopa
Erechthias contributa
Erechthias decaspila
Erechthias dochmogramma
Erechthias epispora
Erechthias eurynipha
Erechthias saitoiMecomodica fullawayi is also sometimes placed in Comodica; it might alternatively belong in Erechthias or represent a distinct lineage not much closer to either of the two than to the other.
