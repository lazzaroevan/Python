The Greater Martinique skink (Mabuya mabouya) is a species of skink found on Martinique.  It has shiny, bronze-colored skin, with a pair of light stripes that run along its upper flanks.
It was previously thought to be widespread throughout the Neotropics, but a taxonomic revision in 2005 established it as endemic to Martinique. With its new, restricted distribution, it is feared to be possibly extinct.
