Coleophora solidaginella is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in Spain and Portugal.
The larvae feed on Dittrichia viscosa and Solidago species. They create a laterally compressed spatulate leaf case of about 12 mm (0.47 in). The rear end is hardly narrowed, squarely cut off and bivalved. The mouth angle is about 30Â°. The larva makes two or three cases. Once the larvae have attached the case to a leaf they may leave their case and sometimes make real galleries. Larvae can be found up to May.
