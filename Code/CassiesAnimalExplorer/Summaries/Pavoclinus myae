Pavoclinus myae, Mya's klipfish, is a species of clinid found from East London to Algoa Bay along the coast of South Africa where it can be found in the subtidal zone from near the surface to 3 metres (9.8 ft).  It can reach a maximum length of 5 centimetres (2.0 in) TL.  This species feeds primarily on amphipods, isopods and tanaids. The specific name honours the author's then fianc√©e, Mya van Harten.
