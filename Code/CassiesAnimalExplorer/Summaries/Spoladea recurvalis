The wingspan is 22â€“24 mm. The moth flies from May to September depending on the location.
The larvae feed on spinach, beet, cotton, maize and soybean. They feed on the underside of the leaves protected by a slight web. The larvae are green and resemble the ribs of the leaf somewhat. When fully grown, they are about 19 mm long.
The pupa is formed within a slight cocoon in a folded piece of leaf. It is very pale brown. The pupal period lasts about 12 days.
