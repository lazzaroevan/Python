Peradectes is an extinct genus of small metatherian mammals known from the Cretaceous and Paleocene of North and South America through the Eocene of North America and parts of Europe. The first discovered fossil, P. elegans, was one of 15 Peradectes specimens described in 1921 from the Mason pocket fossil beds in Colorado.
