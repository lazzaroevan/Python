Archaea is an extinct genus of spiders in the family Archaeidae. As of October 2016, four species are placed (or possibly placed) in the genus. All have been found preserved in amber, either from the Baltic or Bitterfeld, Germany. First described in 1854, Archaea species have a distinctive "neck" separating the head from the thorax, and very long chelicerae ("jaws").
