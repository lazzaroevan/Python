Pseudochazara atlantis is a species of butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. It is endemic to Morocco. It flies in barren rocky slopes. The male is found only on large tabular spaces and bare mountain peaks, while the female wanders on the slopes, both for foraging the flowers of Compositae or thyme and to lay her eggs.
