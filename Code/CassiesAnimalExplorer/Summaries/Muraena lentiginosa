Muraena lentiginosa is a moray eel from the Eastern Pacific. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 61 cm in length. The minimum tank size for jeweled moray eels is 50 US gallons (190 L).  Two should not be kept in the same tank unless the tank is over 120 US gallons (450 L).  Both eels must be introduced to the tank at the same time.
