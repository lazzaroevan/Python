The Argentine black and white tegu (Salvator merianae), also commonly called the Argentine giant tegu, the black and white tegu, the huge tegu, and lagarto overo in Spanish is a species of lizard in the family Teiidae. The species is the largest of the "tegu lizards". It is an omnivorous species which inhabits the tropical rain forests, savannas, and semi-deserts of eastern and central South America.
Tegus are sometimes kept as pets. They are notable for their unusually high intelligence and can also be house-broken. Like other reptiles, tegus go into brumation in autumn when the temperature drops. They exhibit a high level of activity during their wakeful period of the year.
Tegus fill ecological niches similar to those of monitor lizards, and are an example of convergent evolution.
