Phenacodontidae is an extinct family of large herbivorous mammals traditionally placed in the “wastebasket taxon” Condylarthra, which may instead represent early-stage perissodactyls. They lived between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs (about 60–50 million years ago) and their fossil remains have been found in North America and Europe, and it is closely related to the horse.
