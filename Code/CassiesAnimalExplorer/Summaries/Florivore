In zoology, a florivore (not to be confused with a folivore) is an animal which mainly eats products of flowers. Florivores are types of herbivores (often referred to as floral herbivores), yet within the feeding behaviour of florivory, there are a range of other more specific feeding behaviours, including, but not limited to:
Granivory: the consumption of grain and seeds
Nectarivory: the consumption of flower nectar
Palynivory: the consumption of flower pollen
Frugivory: the consumption of fruit
