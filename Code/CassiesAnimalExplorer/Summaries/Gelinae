Gelinae is a subfamily of wasps in the family Ichneumonidae. The name is not universally accepted; it is also called Phygadeuontinae, Hemitelinae, and Cryptinae by various authorities. Gelinae was the name used by H. K. Townes in 1969.

Species are distributed worldwide. A 5-sided areolet, a short sternaulus, and a puffy face with a convex clypeus are diagnostic characters for most members of this large subfamily. There are about 400 genera.
