Solariella is a genus of small to minute sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Solariellidae within the superfamily Trochoidea, the top snails, turban snails and their allies.
This genus was founded by S. Wood for an English fossil trochid, conical in form, with tubular whorls and a deep umbilicus, its margin crenulated.
