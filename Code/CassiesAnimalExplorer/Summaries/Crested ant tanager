The crested ant tanager (Habia cristata) is a songbird species. Though it was formerly placed in the tanager family (Thraupidae), it is not actually a tanager. Today it is assigned to the cardinal family (Cardinalidae).
It is endemic to Colombia, where it is found in the western slopes of the Cordillera Occidental. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.
