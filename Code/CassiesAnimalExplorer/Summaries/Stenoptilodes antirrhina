Stenoptilodes antirrhina, the snapdragon plume moth, is a moth of the family Pterophoridae. It is known from California in the United States, but also from greenhouses in the south-eastern U.S. that have received cuttings of snapdragon from California.The wingspan is 15â€“25 mm.
The larvae feed on Antirrhinum species (including Antirrhinum majus), as well as Pelargonium x hortorum. Young larvae mine the leaves and later burrow into the stem, petioles, flowers or seed pods. The development to a full-grown larva takes three to five weeks. The species overwinters as an adult.
