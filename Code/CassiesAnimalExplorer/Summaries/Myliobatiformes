Myliobatiformes  is one of the four orders of batoids, cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. They were formerly included in the order Rajiformes, but more recent phylogenetic studies have shown the myliobatiforms to be a monophyletic group, and  its more derived members evolved their highly flattened shapes independently of the skates.
