Lysinibacillus sphaericus (reclassified - previously known as Bacillus sphaericus) is a Gram-positive, mesophilic, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found on soil. It can form resistant endospores that are tolerant to high temperatures, chemicals and ultraviolet light and can remain viable for long periods of time. It is of particular interest to the World Health Organization due to the larvicide effect of some strains against two mosquito genera (Culex and Anopheles), more effective than Bacillus thuringiensis, frequently used as a biological pest control. L. sphaericus cells in a vegetative state are also effective against Aedes aegypti larvae, an important vector of yellow fever and dengue viruses.
L. sphaericus  has five homology groups (I-V), with group II further dividing into subgroups IIA and IIB. Due to the low levels of homology between groups, it has been suggested that each might represent a distinct species, but owing to a lack of research on this topic, all remain designated as L. sphaericus.
