The collared trogon (Trogon collaris) is a near passerine bird in the trogon family, Trogonidae. It is found in the warmer parts of the Neotropics and includes numerous subspecies, including T. c. exoptatus from northern Colombia, northern Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. The subspecies T. c. aurantiiventris is recognized by many authorities as a separate species: the orange-bellied trogon.
It is a resident of tropical forests, where it nests in a hole in a termite nest or tree, with a typical clutch of two white eggs.
Collared trogons feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. They typically perch upright and motionless.
Trogons have distinctive male and female plumages, with soft, often colourful, feathers. This species is about 25 cm (9.8 in) long. The back, head and breast of the male are green, and a white line separates the breast from the red underparts. The undertail is white with black barring, and the wings are black, vermiculated with white.
The female has a brown back, head and breast, a relatively uniform undertail (not clearly barred), and underparts that are slightly paler than in the male.
The call is a plaintive caow, caow, caow.
