Phyllobates sp. aff. aurotaenia is a temporary name given to a likely new species of poison dart frog, formerly known as the "red" form of Phyllobates aurotaenia. It is morphologically similar to P. aurotaenia, but genetically it is more closely related to P. terribilis. It can  be distinguished from P. aurotaenia by its uniform chocolate brown or navy blue body, and its orange or red, rather than green or yellow, stripes.
