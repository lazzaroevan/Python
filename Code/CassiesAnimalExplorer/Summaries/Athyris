Athyris is a brachiopod genus with a subequally biconvex shell that is generally wider than long and a range that extends from the Silurian into the Triassic. Athyris is the type genus for the Athyrididae, which belongs to the articulate order Athyridida.  R.C. Moore (1952) gives a shorter range, from the Mid Devonian to the Lower Mississippian.
Alverezites, Bruntonites, and Meristospira are among related genera.
