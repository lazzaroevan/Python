Solmissus, or dinner plate jellyfish, is a genus of hydrozoans. Its species are unique among cnidarians in that they actively hunt for prey as opposed to passively waiting for plankton to pass by. They are found in the deep waters of Monterey Bay, California. They are most likely to be found in the deep sea, mid water (700–1,000 m (2,300–3,300 ft)). They grow to be 20 cm (7.9 in) in diameter. These hydrozoans feed on gelatinous zooplankton, including salps and doliolids, ctenophores, jellyfish, and copepods. . However, Solmissus may be limited to feeding on soft-bodied prey by the type of nematocysts on their tentacles (Mills).
