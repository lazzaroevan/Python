Colugos () are arboreal gliding mammals that are native to Southeast Asia. Their closest evolutionary relatives are primates. There are just two living species of colugos: the Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) and the Philippine flying lemur (Cynocephalus volans). These two species make up the entire family Cynocephalidae () and order Dermoptera. They are the most capable gliders of all gliding mammals. A fur-covered membrane, called patagium, connects to the face, paws, and tail. This enables them to glide in the air for distances of up to 200 meters (650 feet) between trees. They are also known as cobegos or flying lemurs. However, they are not actually lemurs, though they resemble them, and like colugos, some lemur species are nocturnal.
