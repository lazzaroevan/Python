Pseudochazara cingovskii, the Macedonian grayling, is a species of butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. It is found only in the Macedonian village of Pletvar. The males are a little smaller than the females.
It is a cool pale grey brown, the upperside bands being particularly noticeable. Its habitat is scattered with white limestone rocks and when at rest on the white limestone, it is very difficult to notice it due to its very pale underside. The Macedonian Grayling is facing endangerment due to marble quarrying occurring in its habitat. This endemic species is the most threatened butterfly species in Europe, and active conservation efforts are vital for sustaining a healthy population size.
