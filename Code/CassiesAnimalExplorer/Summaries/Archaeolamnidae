Archaelamnidae is an extinct family of sharks from the Cretaceous period. When Underwood & Cumbaa proposed the family in 2010, they included Archaeolamna, Cretodus, Dallasiella,and Telodontaspis. However, Cook et al. 2011 found Archaeolamna the only genus which could be confidently attributed to the family, making it monotypic. Telodontaspis has been considered by subsequent researchers to be a junior synonym to Cretoxyrhina which is within its own family, Cretoxyrhinidae. Likewise, Cretodus has been placed in the proposed family Pseudoscapanorhynchidae by some authors.
