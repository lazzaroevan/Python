Figitidae is a family of parasitoid wasps. The full diversity of this wasp family is not yet known, but about 1400 species have been described to over 130 genera. For example, the largest subfamily, Eucoilinae (previously considered as a separate family, the Eucoilidae), has over 1000 described species so far, but this is probably just a fraction of the total diversity. Figitid species occur throughout most of the world.
