Pethia didi is a species of cyprinid fish which has only been recorded in the vicinity of Myitkyina and Indawgyi Lake in the north of Myanmar.This is a small fish which can reach a length of 4 centimetres (1.6 in) SL. It is generally brownish with a dark vertical bar just behind the operculum and a round dark blotch on the caudal peduncle. The species P. tiantian – with a range close to P. didi – is similarly marked, but P. didi can be distinguished by its truncated lateral line, deeper body and longer dorsal fin, with two rows of dark markings rather than one.
