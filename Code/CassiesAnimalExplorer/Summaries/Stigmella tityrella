Adults are on wing from April to May and again from July to August. There are two generations per year.
The larvae feed on beech (Fagus sylvatica), mining the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a corridor that does not widen much and zigzags between two lateral veins in the direction of the leaf margin.
