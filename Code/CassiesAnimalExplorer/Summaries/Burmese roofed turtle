The Burmese roofed turtle (Batagur trivittata) is one of six species of turtle in the genus Batagur of the family Geoemydidae.
It is endemic to Myanmar, but was believed to be extinct until rediscovered in 2002.The female turtle grows significantly larger than the male and reaches sizes similar to that of a steering wheel; the males' color transforms during breeding season in which their usually green heads turn a bright chartreuse-yellow with bold black markings.Burmese roofed turtles remain very rare in the wild as there are only 5 known females in the wild.An individual was seen in 2007 in Qingping Market in Guangzhou, China.
