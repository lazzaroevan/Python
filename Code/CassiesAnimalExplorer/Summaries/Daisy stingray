The daisy stingray, Dasyatis margarita, is a little-known species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found in shallow waters along the coast of West Africa. This species typically grows to 60 cm (24 in) across and has a rounded pectoral fin disc and (in adults) a wide band of dermal denticles over its back. It is characterized by a greatly enlarged, nacreous denticle in the middle of its back called a "pearl spine"; this feature is shared with the similar but much smaller pearl stingray (D. margaritella), which has often been confused with this species. The daisy stingray feeds mainly on crustaceans and exhibits aplacental viviparity, with litters of 1â€“4 young. Heavily pressured by fisheries and possibly habitat degradation, this once-common species is declining and has been assessed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
