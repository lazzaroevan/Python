Mammomonogamus is a genus of parasitic nematodes of the family Syngamidae that parasitise the respiratory tracts of cattle, sheep, goats, deer, cats, orangutans, and elephants. The nematodes can also infect humans and cause the disease called mammomonogamiasis. Several known species fall under the genus Mammomonogamus, but the most common species found to infest humans is M. laryngeus. Infection in humans is very rare, with only about 100 reported cases worldwide, and is assumed to be largely accidental. Cases have been reported from the Caribbean, China, Korea, Thailand, and Philippines.The worm usually inhabits the upper-respiratory region in the trachea, bronchus, or larynx, and can elicit chronic coughing and asthma-like symptoms. One interesting case from Thailand reported finding worms in the patient's duodenum, suggesting M. laryngeus can also be a gastrointestinal parasite. More research is needed because the life cycle is not completely known. Diagnosis is made by recovering the worms on bronchoscopy or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Due to the scant amount of information available on this parasite in literature, increased awareness is necessary, especially in endemic areas near M. laryngeusâ€™ reservoir hosts, for clinicians, the local population in the endemic area, and traveling tourists, to effectively recognize and prevent mammomonogamiasis.
