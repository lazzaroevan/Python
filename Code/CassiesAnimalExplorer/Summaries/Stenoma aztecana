The forewings are snow white, with four dark fuscous costal spots and a marginal series of nine from apex to tornus, all clearly defined. The first spot is a little below the extreme base of the costa, the second, also a little below the costa, at one-fourth, these are connected by a bright yellow streak along the costa. The third spot, a little beyond the middle, is also separated from the costa by a few bright yellow scales.
