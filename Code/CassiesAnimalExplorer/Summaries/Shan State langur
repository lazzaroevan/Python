The Shan State langur (Trachypithecus melamera) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in eastern Myanmar and southwest China.  It had been generally considered a subspecies or even a synonym of Phayre's leaf monkey (T. phayrei) until Roos, et al, elevated it to species status in 2020.
