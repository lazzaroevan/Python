Arion circumscriptus, common name brown-banded arion, is a species of air-breathing land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Arionidae. It is commonest in woodland, occurring across most of Europe, except for more southern regions, and is also widespread in North America. It has been argued that A. circumscriptus is best considered a colour morph of Arion fasciatus.
