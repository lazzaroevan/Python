Cornufer heffernani, sometimes known as the Solomon Island palm frog,  is a species of frog in the family Ceratobatrachidae. It is endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago where it can be found in at least Buka and Bougainville Islands of Papua New Guinea and Choiseul and Santa Isabel Islands of the Solomon Islands, but probably also more widely. The specific name heffernani honours Mr. N. S. Heffernan, who collected the type series.
