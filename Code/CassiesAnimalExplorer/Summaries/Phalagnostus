Phalagnostus is a genus of small trilobites, in the order Agnostida. It lived during the Middle Cambrian, in what are now Canada (Newfoundland and Northwest Territories), China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, England, France, the Russian Federation (Bennett Island, Yakutia), Wales, Sweden, and possibly the United States (Vermont). The headshield (or cephalon) is almost entirely effaced and wider than the tailshield (or pygidium). The pygidium is also very effaced, but the ovate pygidial axis (or rhachis) is well defined and a border furrow is also present.
