Pseudatemelia subochreella is a species of gelechioid moths. Here, it is placed within the subfamily Amphisbatinae of the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae). The Amphisbatinae have alternatively been merged into the Oecophorinae, raised to full family rank, or placed as a subgroup of the Depressariinae (or Depressariidae if ranked as family).It is found in Europe, where it inhabits woodlands. At the periphery of its range, it is not common; in the UK for example it is only found locally in southern England. The adults fly from May to July depending on the location; they are mainly nocturnal but are sometimes encountered flying around during the day. The wingspan of this moth is about 18 mm; even by the standards of its rather drab genus it is not conspicuously colored, being a ruddy ochraceous brown overall with darker hindwings.Its caterpillars live inside a self-made case built from a folded piece of leaf. They eat dead and decaying leaves and similar plant remains, and probably also rotting wood.
