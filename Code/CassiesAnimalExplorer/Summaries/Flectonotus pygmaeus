Flectonotus pygmaeus (also known as: Puerto Cabello treefrog, Spanish: ranita marsupial pigmea) is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae. It is found on the MÃ©rida Andes and Venezuelan Coastal Range in Venezuela and on adjacent eastern slopes of the northern Cordillera Oriental in Colombia.
Its natural habitat is humid pre-montane forest. It is strongly associated with bromeliads, and can survive in degraded forest if bromeliads are present.
It is threatened by deforestation, and locally, collection of bromeliads.
