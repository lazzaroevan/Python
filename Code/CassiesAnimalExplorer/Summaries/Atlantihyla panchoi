Atlantihyla panchoi, also known as the Guatemala stream frog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is endemic to eastern Guatemala and is only known from three localities in the Sierra de las Minas and Monta√±as del Mico ranges. The specific name panchoi honors Laurence Cooper "Don Pancho" Stuart, an American herpetologist.
