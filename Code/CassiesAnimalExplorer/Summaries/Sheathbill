The sheathbills are a family of birds, Chionidae. Classified in the wader order Charadriiformes, the family contains one genus,  Chionis, with only two species. They breed on subantarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, and the snowy sheathbill migrates to the Falkland Islands and coastal southern South America in the southern winter; they are the only bird family endemic as breeders to the Antarctic region.  They are also the only Antarctic birds without webbed feet.
