Stigmella torminalis is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is only known from one locality in Great Britain and two records in Germany.
The wingspan is 4â€“5 mm.The larvae feed on Sorbus torminalis. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a straight, narrow corridor, gradually becoming wider and more contorted, in the end almost forming a botch. The frass is dispersed linearly throughout. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.
