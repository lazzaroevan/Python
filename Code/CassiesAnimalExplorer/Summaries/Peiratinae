The Peiratinae are a subfamily of assassin bugs (Reduviidae) known as corsairs. The subfamily has a worldwide distribution, but concentrated in tropical areas. About 30 genera with 350 species are described. 
Peirates Serville sensu stricto is one of the largest genera of Peiratinae with about 40 valid species worldwide, mainly distributed in the Oriental, Palearctic and Ethiopian regions. After 1831, the subfamily changed many times as new species were being discovered. The peirates Serville sensu stricto is the one of the 40 that has been identified to have a very different biology. Of the 30-40 known genera, one called the Sirthenea is one that appeared in all continents.
