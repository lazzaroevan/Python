Lithopsyche is a fossil butterfly known from Oligocene-aged strata of the Isle of Wight, England. The sole specimen is too incomplete to allow a certain assignment of a family, but it was placed on its description as a geometrid and more recently in the Riodininae.
The late Eocene-aged Lithodryas styx, of Colorado, was originally described with the same genus name.
