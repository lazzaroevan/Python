The Bunurong Marine and Coastal Park () collectively are a marine park and a coastal park located along the reef and coast of Harmers Haven, Cape Paterson and Inverloch in the South Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia. Collectively, the parks are located approximately 140 kilometres (87 mi) southeast of Melbourne, between Coal Point in the west to Wreck Creek in the east, and are used for walking, picnicking, boating, education and research.
The 1,203-hectare (2,970-acre) Bunurong Marine Park comprises two separate areas along 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of coastline and was gazetted on 17 December 1991 (1991-12-17). The broad rock platforms and underwater reefs of Bunurong Marine Park support a remarkable range of habitats, containing a diverse array of plants and animals.The 93-hectare (230-acre) Bunurong Coastal Park includes the narrow strip of public land adjacent to Bunurong Marine Park and Bunurong Marine National Park, between the eastern boundary of the Cape Paterson Foreshore Reserve at Undertow Bay in the west and Wreck Creek in the east, and was gazetted in June 1984.Both parks draw their name from the Australian Aboriginal Bunurong people who are the traditional owners of the land and water in the region.
