The fangtooth moray (sometimes tiger moray or bird-eye conger) is a moray eel of the family Muraenidae found in warmer parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, Canary Islands, Madeira and various other islands. 
The fangtooth moray is distinctive for its bright yellow colouring and elongated jaw, which is filled with a large number of long "glasslike" teeth. It can reach up to 120 cm (47 in) in length. The fangtooth moray is a demersal species, inhabiting rocky bottoms rich in crevices. The moray eels are nocturnal carnivores mainly feeding on benthic fish, cephalopods and crustaceans.
