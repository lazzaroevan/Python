Paraclinus fasciatus, the banded blenny, is a species of labrisomid blenny native to the Atlantic Ocean including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea from southern Florida to Venezuela. The banded blenny is a marine organism, meaning it lives in an aquatic environment. This species lives in the vicinity of coral reefs preferring sea grass beds in shallow waters down to 2 metres (6.6 ft). Although they are typically located in shallow waters, their colors camouflage them exceptionally well, leading to them rarely being seen or recognized. They have also been found within floating algae.
They are part of the family perciform teleost fishes within the sub order Blenniodei. The suborder blenniodei currently comprises 6 families, 151 genera, and 883 species. The perciform fish lineage is distinguished by its small body size, as well as their coastal and benthic habitats. The banded blenny has a typical lifespan of one year.
