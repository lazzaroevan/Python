The Formosan sika deer, (Chinese: 台灣梅花鹿; pinyin: Táiwān méihuālù; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tâi-oân hoe-lo̍k), is a subspecies of sika deer endemic to the island of Taiwan. Formosan sika, like most of the terrestrial fauna and flora of Taiwan, arrived on the island during Pleistocene glacial periods when lower sea levels connected Taiwan to the Asian mainland.
