Coleophora lycii is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in Turkestan and Uzbekistan.
The larvae feed on Lycium ruthenicum. They create a leafy case, consisting of five or six pieces, the length of which is distinctly greater toward the front. The valve is two-sided. The length of the case is 10–12 mm (0.39–0.47 in) and it is yellow to chocolate-brown in color. Larvae can be found from July to October and (after hibernation) from the end of April to May.
