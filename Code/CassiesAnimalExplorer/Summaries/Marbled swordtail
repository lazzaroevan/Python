The marbled swordtail (Xiphophorus meyeri) is a species of freshwater fish in the family Poeciliidae. It was endemic to the Rio Salado system (itself a part of the Rio Grande basin) in northeastern Mexico.The marbled swordtail is considered extinct in the wild by the IUCN, meaning that it only survives in captivity at the Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center, Texas State University. The marbled swordtail shared the title as northernmost naturally distributed Xiphophorus with the closely related Monterrey platyfish (X. couchianus) and northern platyfish (X. gordoni). The specific name of this species honours the German ichthyologist Manfred K. Meyer.
