Felicola isidoroi, the Iberian lynx louse, is a species of trichodectid chewing louse. It is known only from a single specimen, a male, and likely died out when the last survivors of its host species, the Iberian lynx, were taken into captivity and de-loused. The female has never been seen. The type specimen is in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid.
