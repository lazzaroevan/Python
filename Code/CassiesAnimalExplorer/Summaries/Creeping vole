The creeping vole (Microtus oregoni), sometimes known as the Oregon meadow mouse, is a small rodent in the family Cricetidae.  Ranging across the Pacific Northwest of North America, it is found in forests, grasslands, woodlands, and chaparral environments.  The small-tailed, furry, brownish-gray mammal was first described in the scientific literature in 1839, from a specimen collected near the mouth of the Columbia River.  The smallest vole in its range, it weighs around 19 g (0.67 oz).  At birth, they weigh 1.6 g (0.056 oz), are naked, pink, unable to open their eyes, and the ear flaps completely cover the ear openings.  Although not always common throughout their range, there are no major concerns for their survival as a species.
