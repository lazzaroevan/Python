The humpbacked limia or black-barred limia (Limia nigrofasciata) is a species of poeciliid endemic to Haiti.  This species grows to a length of 5.2 centimetres (2.0 in) SL.  Its natural habitat is streams and lagoons where it is associated with the cover of aquatic plants. It is also found in the aquarium trade. Males actively court and pursue females. They threaten each other but if the males are evenly matched no damage results. But often the dominant male will harass smaller males until they expire, so often only one male will survive in a colony. They are closely related to the "Tiger" limia.
