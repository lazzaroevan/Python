Cryodraco antarcticus, the long-fingered icefish, is a demersal species of crocodile icefish only found in deep waters of the Southern Ocean. It is found near the South Orkney Islands, the Antarctic Peninsula, the Weddell, Bellinghausen, Ross and Davis seas at depths of 90 to 600 m (295 to 1970 ft).This species is pale greyish-brown with 5-6 dark cross-bars on its body and dusky-tipped pelvic fins. It is distinguished by the elongate shape of its pelvic fins, which are blackish in the pelagic juveniles. This species feeds on fishes and krill (studies from 1982 to 1984 revealed mostly fishes and Antarctic krill)and can grow up to 39.3 cm (15.5 in). The larvae have a long late winter pelagic phase. It is of minor importance to commercial fisheries.
