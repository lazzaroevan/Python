The common puddle frog, puddle frog, or yellow bellied puddle frog (Occidozyga laevis) is a species of frog in the family Dicroglossidae. It has often been confused with Occidozyga sumatrana (which until 1998 was considered to be a junior synonym O. laevis), and records of this species outside the Philippines likely represent that species.
