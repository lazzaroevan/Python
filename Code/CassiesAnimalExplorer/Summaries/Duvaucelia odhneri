Duvaucelia odhneri, is a species of dendronotid nudibranch. It is a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Tritoniidae.
The specific name odhneri is in honour of Swedish malacologist Nils Hjalmar Odhner. This species was originally described as Duvaucelia odhneri but this became a homonym of Tritonia odhneri Marcus, 1959 when the genus Duvaucelia was moved within Tritonia in 1983. In 2020 the genus Duvaucelia was brought back into use and the name reverted to the original combination of Tardy, 1963.
