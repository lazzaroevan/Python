Archipsocus nomas is a web-spinning barklouse, a psocid in the insect family Archipsocidae. It is found in the southeast of the United States, living gregariously on trees, feeding on and lichen and fungi and spinning a web that adheres to the trunk and large branches in sheets. The webs are thought to protect the barklice from predators and neither the insects nor the webs cause damage to the trees.
