Cooloola is a genus of ensiferan orthopterans known as Cooloola monsters. It is the only genus in the subfamily Cooloolinae and family Cooloolidae of the superfamily Stenopelmatoidea.
Four species are known from this family, all endemic to Queensland, Australia. The name originated from the discovery of the best-known member of the family, the Cooloola monster (Cooloola propator), in the Cooloola National Park.
Little is known about their life histories as they lead an almost entirely subterranean existence, but  they are believed to prey on other soil-dwelling invertebrates.  Cooloola monsters are unusual in comparison with other members of the primitive superfamily Stenopelmatoidea in that the cooloolids' antennae are considerably shorter than their body lengths.
Species include:
Cooloola dingo Rentz, 1986 – dingo monster
Cooloola pearsoni Rentz, 1999 – Pearson's monster
Cooloola propator Rentz, 1980 – Cooloola monster
Cooloola ziljan Rentz, 1986 – sugarcane monster
