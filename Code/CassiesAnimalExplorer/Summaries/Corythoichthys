Corythoichthys is a genus of pipefishes of the family Syngnathidae. All species in the genus are found in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans on reefs or rubble bottoms. Relationships and taxonomy within the genus are still in debate, but there may be at least 23 species.
Males and females engage in seasonal pair bonding and are most often found in pairs on reefs. During courtship, the male and female "dance" around one another above the substrate. The female lays her eggs in a sheet, which she then presses against the underside of the male. The male will then grow skin over the eggs to form a brood pouch. Small pipefish hatch out of the eggs within a few weeks.
