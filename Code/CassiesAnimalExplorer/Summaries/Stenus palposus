Stenus palposus (also known as Metastenus palposus or the Lough Neagh camphor beetle) is a species of beetle of the subfamily Steninae in the family Staphylinidae. As a predatory insect, it feeds on other smaller arthropods such as springtails.It is now restricted to parts of northern Europe such as Sweden, Finland and Russia, having gone extinct in areas like Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland sometime before 1996. It lives in damp areas of open fine sand beaches where they have been observed hunting by running their prey down.
