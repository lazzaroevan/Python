Caiman venezuelensis is an extinct species of caiman that lived in South America during the Pleistocene. The holotype of C. venezuelensis — OR-1677, a partial left premaxilla bone — was discovered in the locality of El Breal of Orocual, in the Mesa Formation, in the state of Monagas, Venezuela, the country of which derives their species name.Cidade et al. (2019) rejected the classification of C. venezuelensis as a distinct species, and considered it to be a junior synonym of the extant spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus).
