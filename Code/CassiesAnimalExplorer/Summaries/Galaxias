Galaxias is a genus of small, highly successful freshwater fish in the family Galaxiidae. They are typically found at temperate latitudes across the Southern Hemisphere and are frequently referred to as galaxiids.
Galaxiids are scaleless and somewhat tubular in body form, ranging from very slender to quite bulky. They are somewhat torpedo-shaped, with the dorsal and anal fins positioned close to the tail. They are generally small, with typical adults ranging between 4–15 cm (1.6–5.9 in) in total length, with some stocky species attaining around 25 cm (10 in). The largest, Galaxias argenteus, has been recorded at 58 cm (1.90 ft), although 30–40 cm (12–16 in) is a more typical adult length.
