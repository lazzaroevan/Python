The Arcida is an extant order of  bivalve molluscs.  This order dates back to the lower Ordovician period. They are distinguished from related groups, such as the mussels, by having a straight hinge to the shells, and the adductor muscles being of equal size.  The duplivincular ligament, taxodont dentition, and a shell microstructure consisting of the outer crossed lamellar and inner complex crossed lamellar layers are defining characters of this order.Seven families are currently recognised within the order, including the well-known ark clams or ark shells in the family Arcidae.
