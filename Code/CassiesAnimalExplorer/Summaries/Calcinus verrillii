Calcinus verrillii, commonly known as Verrill's hermit crab, is a species of hermit crab in the genus Calcinus which is endemic to Bermuda. It was first described by the American zoologist Mary J. Rathbun and named in honour of the American zoologist Addison Emery Verrill, who spent much time with his students studying the geology and marine fauna of Bermuda.
Although this hermit crab species generally inhabits the discarded shell of a free-living gastropod mollusc, it sometimes makes use of the empty, tube-like shells of  certain gastropod mollusc species while the tube is permanently cemented to rocks in the reef.
