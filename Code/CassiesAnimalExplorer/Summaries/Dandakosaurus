Dandakosaurus (meaning "Dandakaranya lizard") is a genus of theropod dinosaur from the Kota Formation, Andhra Pradesh, India. It lived 183 to 175 million years ago in the Toarcian, Early Jurassic. It is currently classified as Averostra incertae sedis, variously suggested to be a ceratosaur or basal tetanuran.The type species, D. indicus, was named by Yadagiri in 1982. Little is known about the genus, as the only fossil evidence is a partial pubis - some paleontologists consider it to be a nomen dubium. In 2016 It was estimated to be 10 meters (33 feet) in length and 2.3 tonnes (2.5 short tons) in weight.
