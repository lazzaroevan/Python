The ash pug (Eupithecia innotata f. fraxinata, originally known by the binomial name Eupithecia fraxinata, but now believed to be a form of Eupithecia innotata) is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is widely distributed in the UK.
The forewings are generally dark brown or grey with few distinguishing marks apart from a small white tornal spot which may not be present on the frequent melanic forms. The wingspan is 18â€“24 mm. Two broods are produced each year with the adults flying in May and June and again in August.[1] Moths of the spring brood are usually darker in colour than the later specimens.
The caterpillars feed on ash. The species overwinters as a pupa.
