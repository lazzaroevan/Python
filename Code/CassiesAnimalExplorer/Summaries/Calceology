Calceology (from Latin calcei "shoes" and  -λογία, -logiā, "-logy") is the study of footwear, especially historical footwear whether as archaeology, shoe fashion history, or otherwise. It is not yet formally recognized as a field of research. Calceology comprises the examination, registration, research and conservation of leather shoe fragments. A wider definition includes the general study of the ancient footwear, its social and cultural history,  technical aspects of pre-industrial shoemaking and associated leather trades, as well as reconstruction of archaeological footwear.
