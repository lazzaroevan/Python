Cryopterygius (meaning 'frozen fin' in Greek) is an extinct genus of ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur known from the uppermost Jurassic of Central Spitsbergen, Norway. The type species, Cryopterygius kristiansenae , is known from a single, but largely complete specimen from the Slottsmøya Member of the Agardhfjellet Formation (middle Volgian/late Tithonian, Late Jurassic). With a total length of 5.0–5.5 metres (16.4–18.0 ft), it is a large ichthyosaur. A second species, C. kielanae, was found in the Kcynia Formation from the Late Jurassic of Poland. It is smaller than the type species, with a length of 3.5–4 metres (11–13 ft).
