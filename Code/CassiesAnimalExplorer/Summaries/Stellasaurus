Stellasaurus (meaning "star lizard"; both in reference to the shape of its head ornamentation and as an homage to the song "Starman" by David Bowie) is a genus of centrosaurine ceratopsid dinosaur that lived in Montana during the Late Cretaceous. The type and only species is Stellasaurus ancellae. Its remains have been found in the Late Campanian age Two Medicine Formation, the same geological unit which its relatives Rubeosaurus, Einiosaurus, and Achelousaurus were discovered in.Originally proposed as a distinct taxon in 1992, the specimens were later assigned to Rubeosaurus. In 2020 a re-evaluation questioned the referral and named it as a distinct species in a new genus. The describers saw it as a transitional form between Styracosaurus albertensis and Einiosaurus on a single evolutionary line that led to Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus.
