Lyroneurus is a genus or subgenus of flies in the family Dolichopodidae. Its rank is not currently certain; it has variously been placed as its own genus or as a subgenus of Diaphorus. More recently, it has been suggested by Pollet et al. (2004) to be a synonym of Chrysotus, but some authors maintain generic rank noting that Chrysotus is possibly paraphyletic.
