Pseudochampsa is an extinct genus of proterochampsid archosauriform known from the Late Triassic (Carnian) Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation of San Juan Province, Ischigualasto-Villa Uni√≥n Basin in northwestern Argentina. It contains a single species, Pseudochampsa ischigualastensis, originally named as a second species of the closely related Chanaresuchus, based on a fairly complete articulated skeleton and skull. A revision of the remains concluded that it was best to move to species to its own genus, as no traits were found to unite P. ischigualastensis and the type species of Chanaresuchus to the exclusion of other proterochampsids. A phylogenetic analysis places both species in a polytomy with Gualosuchus as the most advanced members of Proterochampsia.
