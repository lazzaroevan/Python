Stigmella lonicerarum is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found from Sweden and Finland to the Pyrenees, Italy and Bulgaria, and from France to Russia.

The wingspan is 4â€“5 mm.
The larvae feed on Lonicera caprifolium, Lonicera nigra and Lonicera xylosteum. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long, narrow corridor, which follows the leaf margin at first. The frass is concentrated in a narrow central line.
