Paraulax queulensis is a species of gall wasp. Biology of Paraulax species is unknown but given they are associated with Nothofagus forests their biology is probably associated with the pteromalid gall community. This species is named after the place where it was first collected, Los Queules National Reserve. P. queulensis closely resembles P. perplexa, bearing common traits such as colour, habitus and several morphological characters. P. queulensis differs by having a more elongate body, which in the female is 4 times longer than it is high; its mesosoma is 1.6 times longer than high, while its metasoma is 1.9 times longer than high. The mesosoma is more dorsoventrally depressed. Its pronotum s 1.5 times longer laterally than high. It possesses longitudinal costulae running from the lateral margin of its pronotal plate to its lateral surface. Its scutellar foveae is discernible even when shallow (Fig. 4C). The antenna also differs: the pedicel of the female antenna is 1.4 times longer than wide.
