The fortune jack (Seriola peruana), also known as the darkfin amberjack, is a species of ray-finned fish from the family Carangidae. It is found in the eastern Pacific from Mexico to Ecuador and on the Galapagos Islands. It is a benthopelagic and demersal fish of coastal areas, including areas of rocky reefs to 30 metres (98 ft). This species was formally described by the Austrian ichthyologist Franz Steindachner (1834-1919) in 1881 with the type locality given as Callao in Peru.
