Pholas dactylus, or common piddock, is a bioluminescent clam-like species of marine mollusc found on the coasts of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. It bores into gneiss. It was once a highly esteemed food in Europe.

It is sensitive to light, retracting into its shell when exposed to it.
