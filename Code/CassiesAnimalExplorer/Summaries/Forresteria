Forresteria is an extinct genus of cephalopod belonging to the subclass Ammonoidea. They flourished during the late Turonian and early Coniacian of the Late Cretaceous, and were global in extent. Forresteria alluaudi and Forresteria hobsoni are considered marker fossils for the lower Coniacian in the American West.
