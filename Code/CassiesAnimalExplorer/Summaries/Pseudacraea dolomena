Pseudacraea dolomena, the variable false acraea, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. It is found in Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. The habitat consists of forests.
It mimics Bematistes species, but is not a very good mimic. It is probably more reliant on its more powerful flight for protection from predators.
In flight, the nominate subspecies is almost impossible to distinguish from its model, Amauris echeria. Subspecies morogoro mimics Amauris echeria serica, subspecies tanganyikae mimics Amauris echeria terrena and subspecies reducta mimics Amauris albimaculata hanningtoni
The larvae feed on Pachystela subcaudata and Afrosersalisia species.
