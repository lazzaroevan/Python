Dysdera erythrina is a species of spider in the family Dysderidae. It is nearly indistinguishable from the spider Dysdera crocata, but is far less common and has a much smaller geographic range. Like its relative D. crocata, this spider uses its disproportionately huge chelicerae to kill woodlice, as well as silverfish, earwigs, millipedes, beetles, and even centipedes.
