The flightless cormorant (Phalacrocorax harrisi), also known as the Galapagos cormorant, is a cormorant endemic to the Galapagos Islands, and an example of the highly unusual fauna there. It is unique in that it is the only known cormorant that has lost the ability to fly. Once it was placed in its own genus, Nannopterum, although current taxonomy places it in the genus with most of the other cormorants, Phalacrocorax.
