The South American great horned owl (Bubo virginianus nacurutu), also known as the Colombian great horned owl, Venezuelen great horned owl, or desert great horned owl, is a subspecies of the great horned owl, Bubo virginianus. It lives in tropical South America. It generally occurs in more open areas than the North American great horned owls, and avoids dense humid forest, e.g. the Amazon Rainforest. Unlike other subspecies of the great horned owl, the eyes of the South American horned owl are amber rather than yellow. Although the largest owl in its range, it is a relatively small horned owl.
