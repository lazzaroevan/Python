The spadebills are a genus, Platyrinchus, of Central and South American passerine birds in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. They have broad, flat, triangular bills.
The genus was erected by the French zoologist Anselme GaÃ«tan Desmarest in 1805 with the white-crested spadebill (Platyrinchus platyrhynchos) as the type species. The name Platyrhynchos is from the Ancient Greek platus "broad" and rhunkhos  "bill".The genus contains seven species:
Cinnamon-crested spadebill, Platyrinchus saturatus
Stub-tailed spadebill, Platyrinchus cancrominus
Yellow-throated spadebill, Platyrinchus flavigularis
Golden-crowned spadebill, Platyrinchus coronatus
White-throated spadebill, Platyrinchus mystaceus
White-crested spadebill, Platyrinchus platyrhynchos
