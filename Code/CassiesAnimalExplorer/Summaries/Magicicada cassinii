Magicicada cassinii, sometimes called the 17-year cicada, Cassin's periodical cicada or the dwarf periodical cicada,  is a species of periodical cicada. It is endemic to North America. It has a 17-year lifecycle but is otherwise indistinguishable from the 13-year periodical cicada Magicicada tredecassini. The two species are usually discussed together as "cassini periodical cicadas" or "cassini-type periodical cicadas." Unlike other periodical cicadas, cassini-type males may synchronize their courting behavior so that tens of thousands of males sing and fly in unison. The specific name cassinii was in honour of John Cassin, an American ornithologist.
