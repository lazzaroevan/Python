Lusius Quietus (Latin: Lusius Quiētus pronounced [ˈɫ̪ʊ.s̠i.ʊs̠ kᶣiˈeː.t̪ʊs̠]; Koinē Greek: Λούσιος Κυήτος, Loúsios Kyítos pronounced [ˈlu.s̠i.os̠ kyˈi.tos̠]) was a Roman general and governor of Judaea in AD 117. He was the principal commander against the Jewish rebellion known as the Kitos War ("Kitos" is a later corruption of "Quietus"). As both a general and a highly acclaimed commander, he was notably one of the most accomplished Berber statesmen in ancient Roman history. After the death of the emperor Trajan, Quietus was murdered or executed, possibly on the orders of Trajan's successor Hadrian.
