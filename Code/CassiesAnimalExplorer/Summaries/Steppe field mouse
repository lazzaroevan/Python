The steppe field mouse (Apodemus witherbyi) is a species of rodent in the family Muridae found in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and probably Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria.  The Mount Hermon field mouse (sometimes recognized as a distinct species: A. hermonensis) and the yellow-breasted field mouse (sometimes recognized as a distinct species: A. fulvipectus) were considered conspecific with the steppe field mouse by Musser and Carleton (2005).
