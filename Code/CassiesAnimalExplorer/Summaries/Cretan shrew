The Cretan shrew (Crocidura zimmermanni) is a species of mammal in the family Soricidae. It is endemic and exclusive to the island of Crete, Greece.  Its natural habitat is temperate shrubland, and the animal is threatened by habitat loss.  It is found in the mountainous highlands of Crete, having been displaced from lower altitudes by the lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens).
