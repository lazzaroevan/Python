Thaumatogryllus is a genus of crickets in the family Gryllidae.  It currently consists of four species, all of which are endemic to Hawai ªi. Though very little is known about any of these species, it can be confirmed that T. conantae shows obvious signs of island gigantism. The other three species, especially T. cavicola, may also be affected by this phenomenon.
