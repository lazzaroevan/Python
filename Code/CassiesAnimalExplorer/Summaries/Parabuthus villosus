The black hairy thick-tailed scorpion, Parabuthus villosus, is a species of scorpion from southern Africa, where it ranges from the Northern Cape to Namibia. It is the largest species of the Buthidae, measuring up to 18 cm, and its diet may include lizards and mice. The species is often active at dawn and dusk, but takes refuge by day in a variety of shelters. It resembles Parabuthus transvaalicus, which is more strictly nocturnal, less hairy and with a more easterly distribution.
