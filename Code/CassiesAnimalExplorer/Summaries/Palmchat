The palmchat (Dulus dominicus) is a small, long-tailed passerine bird, the only species in the genus Dulus and the family Dulidae endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (split between the Dominican Republic and Haiti).  It is thought to be related to the waxwings, family Bombycillidae, and is sometimes classified with that group.  Its name reflects its strong association with palms for feeding, roosting, and nesting.
The palmchat is the national bird of the Dominican Republic.
