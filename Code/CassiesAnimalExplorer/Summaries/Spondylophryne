Spondylophryne villanyensis is name given to a prehistoric amphibian placed in the family Discoglossidae (=Alytidae). It was described based on material from Vill√°ny, Hungary. Later studies have criticized the extreme brevity of the description and lack of illustration; the name could be considered a nomen nudum.
