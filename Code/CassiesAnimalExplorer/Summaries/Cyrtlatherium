Cyrtlatherium is a dubious genus of extinct docodontan mammaliaform from the Middle Jurassic rocks of Oxfordshire, England. As it is only known from a few isolated molar teeth, there is disagreement about whether Cyrtlatherium is a separate genus, or whether it is a synonym and the molar teeth are the milk teeth of another genus of docodont.
Cyrtlatherium was named from a few single molar teeth found in the Kirtlington mammal beds in England, which were originally thought to belong to a kuehneotheriid, but were later reclassified as belonging to a docodont. When reclassifying it, Sigogneau-Russell argued that it was the milk tooth of a previously named docodont called Simpsonodon. This is now generally accepted to be the case by most mammal palaeontologists.
