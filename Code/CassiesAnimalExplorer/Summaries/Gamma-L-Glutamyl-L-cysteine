γ -L-Glutamyl-L-cysteine, also known as γ-glutamylcysteine (GGC), is a dipeptide found in animals, plants, fungi, some bacteria, and archaea. It has a relatively unusual γ-bond between the constituent amino acids, L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine and is a key intermediate in the gamma (γ) -glutamyl cycle first described by Meister in the 1970s. It is the most immediate precursor to the antioxidant glutathione.
