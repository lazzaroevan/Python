The common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), also known as the grey or bush duiker, is a small antelope found  everywhere in Africa south of the Sahara, excluding the Horn of Africa and the rainforests of the central and western parts of the continent. Generally, they are found in habitats with sufficient vegetation cover to allow them to hideâ€”savanna and hilly areas, including the fringes of human settlements.
