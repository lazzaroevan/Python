The Colombian chachalaca (Ortalis columbiana) is a species of bird in the family Cracidae. It is endemic to the forests and woodlands in the inter-Andean valleys in Colombia. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the speckled chachalaca.
Some members of the Colombian Chachalaca are seed dispersers and others as predators, thus affecting the recruitment of plants in tropical forests.
Colombian Chachalaca is actively involved in the distribution of seeds from the fruits that it ingests. This chachalaca is a disperser of small seeds of some Melastomataceae, thus facilitating the regeneration of some plant species in areas where it lives.
