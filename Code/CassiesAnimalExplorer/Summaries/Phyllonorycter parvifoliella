Phyllonorycter parvifoliella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from France and Portugal.
The larvae feed on Adenocarpus complicatus. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They create an upper-surface tentiform mine that causes the leaf to contract strongly upwards. Mined leaves are completely eaten out and become whitish. Pupation takes place within the mine.
