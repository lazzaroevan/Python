Paraulax ronquisti is a species of gall wasp. Biology of the Paraulax species is unknown but given they are associated with Nothofagus forests their biology is probably associated with the pteromalid gall community. It is named in honour of Fredrik Ronquist. This species differs from P. perplexa and P. queulensis by its body's red-brown color, the shape of the antennal flagellomeres F3 and F4, the faint notauli and its smooth and shiny mesopleuron. It has an elongated body like P. queulensis.
