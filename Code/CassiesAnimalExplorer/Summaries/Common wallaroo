The common wallaroo (Osphranter robustus), also known as the euro, hill wallaroo, or simply wallaroo is a species of macropod. The word euro is particularly applied to one subspecies (O. r. erubescens).The eastern wallaroo is mostly nocturnal and solitary, and is one of the more common macropods. It makes a loud hissing noise and some of the other subspecies are sexually dimorphic, like most wallaroos.
