Myobatrachus is a genus of frogs found in Western Australia. It is monotypic, being represented by the single species, Myobatrachus gouldii, also known as the turtle frog. It has a small head, short limbs, and a round body, up to 45 millimetres (1.8 in) long.The turtle frog is found in between Geraldton and Fitzgerald River in the Perth region, Western Australia. This area is mainly semi-arid, so the frogs have adapted to suit this region. They have developed short muscular limbs to help them dig into the sand but, unlike most frogs, they dig forward, like a turtle. They feed on termites so the adaptation of the muscular limbs is useful when trying to penetrate a termite mound.
