Aumakua is a genus of moths of the family Noctuidae, consisting of one species Aumakua omaomao, which is endemic to Hawaii.
Adults are known to fly at dusk.
The larvae feed on Clermontia fauriei and Trematolobelia kauaiensis. They cut the plant (early instars create discs in the leaf, while later instars cut along the edge), thus allowing the latex to drain before consuming the plant material.
