Pauline avibella is a fossil ostracod from the Silurian with unusually well preserved soft parts, including limbs, eyes, gills and alimentary system.The tiny shelled arthropod was found in 425-million-year-old rocks in the Herefordshire Lagerst√§tte in England near the Welsh Border. The rocks at the site date to the Silurian period of geological time. At the time, southern Great Britain was a sea area on a small continent situated in warm, southerly subtropical latitudes. The marine animals living there were covered by a fall of volcanic ash that preserved them frozen in time.
