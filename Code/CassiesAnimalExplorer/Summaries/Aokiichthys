Aokiichthys is an extinct genus of basal osteoglossoid from  an Early Cretaceous freshwater palaeolake of what is now Kyushu, Japan.  The genus formed a species radiation in the First Formation within the Wakino Subgroup of the Kwanmon Group, as a dominant member and namesake of the Nipponamia-Aokiichthys fauna.  The genus became extinct at the end of either the 1st Formation, or possibly during the 2nd Formation, when the palaeolake became shallower.
Aokiichthys is described as being closely related to the genera Yungkangichthys, and Paralycoptera (at the time of Aokiichthys' description, all three genera were thought to be lycopterids).  In their 2009 study, Xu and Chang reassess Paralycoptera to be a basal osteoglossoid, and synonymized both Yungkangichthys and Aokiichthys into Paralycoptera.
