Madakoala was a genus of extinct phascolarctid marsupials with only three known subspecies, Madakoala devisi, Madakoala wellsi and Madakoala robustus, and seven sister species, Invictokoala, Koobor, Litokoala, Nimiokoala, Perikoala, Phascolarctos, and Priscakoala with only Phascolarctos having an extant species. Madakoala went extinct around 280,000 years ago in the Pleistocene epoch.  They are known to exist by limited cranial material in fossils, so the existence of some of the subspecies is questionable because of missing dental data.
