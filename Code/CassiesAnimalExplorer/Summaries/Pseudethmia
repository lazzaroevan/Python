Pseudethmia is a genus of moths in the family Depressariidae. It contains only one species, Pseudethmia protuberans, which is endemic to lower elevation deserts of south-eastern California and probably north-eastern Baja California.
The length of the forewings is 8–9.9 mm (0.31–0.39 in). The ground color of the forewings is whitish. The markings
are variable in intensity and become dark brownish black streaks between the veins. The ground color of the hindwings is white tinged with pale brownish towards the apex. Adults are on wing in mid-February in the Imperial Valley at sea level, and in early April at the edge of the Mojave
Desert at 2,000 feet (610 m).
