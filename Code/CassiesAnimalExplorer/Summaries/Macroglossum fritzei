The palpus underside is reddish grey. The thorax underside is pale red centrally, darker laterally. The abdomen underside is bright tawny, the apical margins brown with a lateral series of conspicuous buff-yellow spots. The forewing underside is reddish-chestnut, while the extreme base is yellowish, the blackish-brown border is very distinct, due to a series of irregular buff-yellow postdiscal patches.
