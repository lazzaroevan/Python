Pseudojuloides cerasinus, the smalltail wrasse or the pencil wrasee, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a wrasse from the family Labridae. It is found in the tropical Pacific Ocean and was previously considered to have a much wider distribution but the recognition of new species has reduced this wide range.
