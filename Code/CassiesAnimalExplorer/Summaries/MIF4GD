MIF4GD, or MIF4G domain-containing protein, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the MIF4GD gene. It is also known as SLIP1, SLBP (Stem-Loop Binding Protein)-interacting protein 1, AD023, and MIFD. MIF4GD is expressed ubiquitously in humans, and has been found to be involved in activating proteins for histone mRNA translation, alternative splicing and translation of mRNAs, and is a factor in the regulation of cell proliferation.
