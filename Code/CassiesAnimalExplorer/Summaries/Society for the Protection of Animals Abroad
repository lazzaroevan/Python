The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA) is a global charity with the objective and purpose of providing veterinary care to working animals, including donkeys, horses, elephants and camels.
SPANA's mission is to transform the lives of working animals and the developing communities that depend on these animals for their survival, through its Treat, Train and Teach strategy. The charity treats animals who are suffering from injury and illness, or facing emergency situations, through its free provision of veterinary care delivered from a network of hospitals and mobile clinics. It trains animal owners and vets, promoting best practice and care. And the charity teaches children that animals must be treated with care and compassion through its humane education program. 
In 2019, SPANA treated over 385,000 animals across 30 countries, including Morocco, Mali, Mauritania, Botswana, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, South Africa and Jordan.
SPANA is funded entirely by voluntary donations. In 2019, the charity had a global expenditure of Â£9,851,081.
