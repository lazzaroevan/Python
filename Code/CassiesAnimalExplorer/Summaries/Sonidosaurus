Sonidosaurus (meaning "Sonid lizard", after Sonid, the large geographical area that includes the type locality ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a titanosaur which lived in what is now Inner Mongolia. The type species, Sonidosaurus saihangaobiensis, was described by Xu, Zhang, Tan, Zhao, and Tan in 2006.  It was a small titanosaur, about 9 meters (30 ft) long. It was found in the Iren Dabasu Formation; it was only slightly larger than the contemporaneous giant oviraptorid Gigantoraptor.
