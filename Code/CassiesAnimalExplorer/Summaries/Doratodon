Doratodon is an extinct genus of Late Cretaceous crocodylomorph that was once believed to be a dinosaur. Two species of Doratodon are known to science: D. carcharidens from Austria (Grünbach Formation) and Hungary (Csehbánya Formation), the type species; and D. ibericus from Spain (Sierra Perenchiza Formation).The holotype of D. carcharidens consists of a denture and a mandible. Other specimens include a maxilla fragment, a parietal and teeth. The holotype, and only known specimen of D. ibericus, consists of an incomplete left mandible with dentation.
