Phytomyza horticola is a species of leaf-mining fly in the family Agromyzidae of the order Diptera. For a time it was treated as Chromatomyia horticola, but its original name has been restored after genus Chromatomyia was synonymized with Phytomyza. The species is a pest of high economic importance affecting the vegetable crops in temperate and tropical regions.
