Argas persicus, also known as fowl tick or poultry tick, is a small soft-bodied tick that is found primarily on domestic fowl such as chickens, ducks, and geese. It was first recorded by Lorenz Oken in 1818 in Mianeh, Persia, and named Rhynochoprion persicum.
Argas persicus appears yellowish-brown when starved and slatey-blue when engorged. They are found on an animal host, in cracks and crevices of buildings or in nests.They are also carriers of the spirochete bacteria Borrelia anserina which causes avian spirochetosis, one of the most severe diseases affecting the poultry industry.In addition to domestic fowl, A. persicus may also feed on humans, although an immunity has been acquired by some individuals.
