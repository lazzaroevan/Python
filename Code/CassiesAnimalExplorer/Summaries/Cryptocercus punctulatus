Cryptocercus punctulatus, known generally as brown-hooded cockroach, is a species of cockroach in the family Cryptocercidae. Other common names include the woodroach, wingless wood roach, and eastern wood-eating cockroach. It is found in North America.C. punctulatus is an oviparous cockroach in the family Cryptocercidae that excavates galleries in rotted wood.  Field evidence suggests that pairs of C. punctulatus have a single reproductive episode during which they produce a mean of 73 eggs, in up to four oothecae.  An extended period of brood care, which can last three years or longer, follows and includes defense of the family, gallery excavation, sanitation of the nest and, in the early stages, trophallactic feeding of the young.  Nymphs are born without the cellulolytic protozoan symbionts they require to digest their wood diet; consequently, neonates rely on adults for nourishment...
The altricial extreme of the developmental spectrum in cockroaches is currently represented by Cryptocercus punctulatus: this species hatches eyeless, with a pale, thin cuticle, is defended by parents in a nest, and is dependent on parents for symbionts and nourishment.
C. punctulatus require 5-6 years to reach reproductive maturity.  They may be considered "the best living model of the ancestral state of termites" and give insight into "the role of parental care in the evolution of termite eusociality."
