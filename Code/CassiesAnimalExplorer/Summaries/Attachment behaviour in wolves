Attachment behaviour is a behaviour which is observed when an animal forms a strong bond to either a human or another. The behaviour of the animal that is seeking to be close to its object of attachment characterizes this behaviour. Many studies have shown that dogs show attachment behaviour to their human caregivers. Wolves are highly social animals and their social interactions in their packs fit the criteria of attachment behaviour. As dogs are closely related to wolves many investigators have studied wolf attachment behaviour to humans. Wolves that were raised for 3â€“7 weeks showed attachment behaviour to their human caregivers. This attachment behaviour was characterized by preferring to be close to their human caregiver, by seeking contact, and by greeting the caregiver more frequently compared to a stranger. As the wolf is a non-domesticated animal this is an example of attachment behaviour without domestication. Another study showed that wolves that were hand-reared for 16 weeks of their lives by human caregivers showed attachment behaviour to a stranger rather than their caregiver.
