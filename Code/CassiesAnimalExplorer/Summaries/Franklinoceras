Franklinoceras is an extinct gensu of cephalopods from the nautiloid order, Discosorida. Nautiloids comprise a subclass of shelled cephalopods that were once diverse and numerous but are now represented by only a handful of species.
Franklinoceras is an early discosorid from the family Reudemannoceratidae, similar to the ancestral Reudemannoceras. Both are from the early Middle Ordovician; both have endogastric cyrtocones, except in Franklinoceras they are compressed so as to be higher than wide, rather than the other way around as in Reudemannoceras (Teichert, 1964).
