The Atlantic royal flycatcher (Onychorhynchus swainsoni) is a passerine bird in the family Tityridae.
Measuring 16–16.5 cm (6.3–6.5 in), this large-billed flycatcher has a spectacular, but rarely seen, crest. It has largely uniform dull brown upperparts with pale, bright cinnamon rump and tail, a whitish throat, unmarked ochraceous buff underparts. The crest is usually left flat, giving a hammerhead shape to head. When raised, the crest displays a remarkable combination of scarlet, black and blue (yellow replaces red in the female).The Atlantic royal flycatcher is endemic to Atlantic forest in south-eastern Brazil. It is threatened by habitat loss.
