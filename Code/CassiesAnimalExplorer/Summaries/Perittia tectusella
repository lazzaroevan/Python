Perittia tectusella is a moth in the family Elachistidae. It was described by Sruoga in 1997. It is found in Central Asia, where it has been recorded from Tajikistan.
The wingspan is 6.1-7.7 mm. The forewings are dark greyish-brown, mottled by whitish basal parts of the scales. There are two blurred whitish spots near the dorsum. The hindwings are light brownish-grey. Adults are on wing from late July to early September.
The larvae feed on Lonirica korolkowii. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow gallery towards the nearest leaf margin, which it then follows. Later, the mine widens into a blotch. Larvae can be found from mid-June to mid-August.
