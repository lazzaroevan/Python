Pseudoficalbia is a subgenus of the mosquito genus Uranotaenia with 146 species. It was originally created as a genus by Frederick Vincent Theobald in 1911 (the name was applied again as new in 1912); however, it was later treated as a subgenus of Uranotaenia, and then was made a synonym of the same genus. It was later restored as a subgenus by E.L. Peyton in 1972.
