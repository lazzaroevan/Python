Parelasmotherium is an extinct genus of rhinos that lived in Northern China about 11.1 million years ago in the late Miocene. With its large body and its grazing teeth (Hypsodont condition), it belonged to the subfamily Elasmotheriini and was a relative of the later Elasmotherium, which was widespread over large parts of northern Asia in the Pleistocene.
It was named in 1923 and once considered to be a synonym of Sinotherium. At least three species of this genus have been named so far.
