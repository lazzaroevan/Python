Family Challenge is an American game show that aired on The Family Channel from October 2, 1995 to September 7, 1997, lasting for two seasons.  Reruns aired on GSN from April 3 to September 25, 1999.
The first season was hosted by Ray Combs, with Gene Wood serving as announcer. Both had formerly served in the same respective roles for Family Feud. Combs was formerly the host of Family Feud between 1988-1994. After his release from the show, injuries, financial ruin, and the separation of his marriage took a serious toll on his personality, and Combs desperately needed money to make a living, so he decided to take the role as the host of Family Challenge in the first season. The role did not last very long as he left the show and the season wrapped in under a year. Combs died on June 2, 1996 by hanging himself in a Glendale psychiatric ward.
The second season, rechristened The New Family Challenge, was hosted by Michael Burger and announced by Charlie Glaize. The show was created by comedian Dave Thomas and Woody Fraser and was originally produced as a pilot for ABC. Thomas and Fraser were executive producers on the show for its entire run on Family Channel.
