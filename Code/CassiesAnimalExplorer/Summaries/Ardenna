Ardenna is a genus of seabirds, in the family Procellariidae, which comprises a group of medium-sized shearwater species. These were for a long time included in Puffinus, but this genus was split based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA. The genus had been introduced by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853, although the name was first used to refer to a seabird by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603.
