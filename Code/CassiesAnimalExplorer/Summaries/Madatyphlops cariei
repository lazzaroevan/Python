Madatyphlops cariei is an extinct blind snake species which was endemic to Mauritius. It is named for Paul Carié (1876–1930), an amateur naturalist attached to the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, who made excavations in Mare aux Songes around 1900 where the remains of this species were discovered.
