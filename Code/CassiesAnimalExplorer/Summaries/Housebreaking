Housebreaking (American English) or house-training (British English) is the process of training a domesticated animal that lives with its human owners in a house or other residence to excrete (urinate and defecate) outdoors, or in a designated indoor area (such as an absorbent pad or a litter box), rather than to follow its instinctive behaviour randomly inside the house. 
Around 840 million cats and dogs alone are owned as pets around the globe; and in the United States, seventy percent of households own a pet. Thus housebreaking a pet is an experience for the majority of people worldwide. The process requires patience and consistence from the human. Accidents are a part of the process, and if the pet's owner reacts negatively, it could be discouraged, and the success of the training might be delayed.
