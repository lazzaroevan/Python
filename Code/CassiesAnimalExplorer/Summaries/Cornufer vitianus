Cornufer vitianus, commonly known as Fiji ground frog or Viti wrinkled ground frog, is a species of frog in the family Ceratobatrachidae.
It is endemic to Fiji.Presumed to be originally a forest species, it is nowadays also found in a range of man-made habitats, including degraded forest, rural gardens, plantations, and even close to the beach.The Fiji ground frog is found on four larger islands (Taveuni, Vanua Levu, Ovalau, and Gau) and a small island, Viwa, (0.6 ha) off the eastern coast of the main island (Viti Levu) of the Fiji archipelago.  The species maintains populations throughout the forested (primary, secondary and coastal/littoral) parts of these islands (Osborne, unpublished data).
A largish frog, it can grow up to 100 g and to body lengths (SUL) of 110 mm.  The larger individuals tend to be a very dull dark brown (sometimes with yellow spots on either side of the head near the tympanum).  However, smaller adults and juvenile frogs can be highly polymorphic in coloration, with banding and stippling in darker or lighter hues of red, brown, green and curry-yellow.  It is distinguished from the Cornufer vitiensis by its larger size and smaller toe pads.
The Fiji ground is a nocturnal ground dweller, however, individuals have been encountered on low branches and leaves of riparian forest vegetation.  It is thought to be a sit and wait predator, waiting for nocturnal insects to venture nearby.
