Arachana is an extinct genus of rhinesuchid-like temnospondyl known from the Early Triassic Buena Vista Formation of northeastern Uruguay. Arachana was first named by Graciela Pi√±eiro, Alejandro Ramos and Claudia Marsicano in 2012 and the type species is A. nigra. It shares characteristics with both rhinesuchids and lydekkerinids, making it a transitional form between basal and more advanced stereospondyls.
