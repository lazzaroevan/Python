Prosapia bicincta, common name two-lined spittlebug, is a species of insect in the family Cercopidae. It is found in North America.
Adults are black with two lines crossing the wings, ranging from red to orange in color. They reach a length of 8â€“10 mm.
Nymphs feed on various grasses (including centipedegrass, bermudagrass and corn) from within foam (consisting of their own spittle) produced from juices of their host plant. Adults feed on hollies on the underside of the leaves. They can be found in multiple grassy areas and wet grassy areas.
The prospia bicinta is considered to be one of the most important pests due to improving pasture grasses throughout the Southeast (Peck, 1998).
