Loliolus Japonica, the Japanese squid, is a species of squid from the family Loliginidae. As the name suggests, it lives around Japan, but has also been found around Vietnam and China. They are pelagic, living 1â€“30 meters down in the ocean.The Japanese squid has light tan skin, with speckles all over its mantle and tentacles. It has a particularly large mantle, and an unusually wide fin along the mantle as well. It has dark, black eyes. Females are larger than males. The maximum length a male can get is 12 centimeters.A male will perform various rituals to get a female's attention, and after that they will mate. Embryos will hatch into a planktonic stage for a fair amount of time, but will then turn into adults. Males and females die after spawning.
