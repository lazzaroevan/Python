Cuterebra emasculator, the squirrel bot fly, is a species of new world skin bot fly in the family Oestridae. The species was first described by Asa Fitch in 1856.   It is an internal parasite of chipmunks and tree squirrels in the eastern United States.  The species name comes from the belief that larvae ate the testicles of chipmunks.
