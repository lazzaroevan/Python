Arixeniidae is a family of earwigs in the suborder Neodermaptera. Arixeniidae was formerly considered a suborder, Arixeniina, but was reduced in rank to family and included in the new suborder Neodermaptera.Arixeniidae is represented by two genera, Arixenia and Xeniaria, with a total of five species. Arixenia esau and Xeniaria jacobsoni are the most well-known. As with Hemimerina, they are blind, wingless ectoparasites with filiform segmented cerci.  They are ectoparasites of various Southeast Asian bats, particularly of the genus Cheiromeles (i.e., "naked bulldog bats").
