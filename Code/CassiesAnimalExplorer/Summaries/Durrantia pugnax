The forewings are pale cream ochreous, sparsely dusted with dark fuscous scales, distributed for the most part singly, but in a small group at the end of the cell, and again in the fold at about half the wing-length, also in about five small terminal spots on the extreme margin. The hindwings are slightly paler than the forewings, and with a shining silky lustre.The larvae feed on Byrsonima crassifolia.
