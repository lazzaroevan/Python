Mantella baroni (often known by its common names, such as Baron's mantella, the variegated golden frog, or the Madagascar poison frog) is a species of small poisonous frog in the family Mantellidae.
The species was first formally described by George Albert Boulenger in 1888, who penned the species' binomial after Richard Baron, an English botanist and missionary to Madagascar, who collected and studied the species.
