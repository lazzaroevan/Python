Aristotelia corallina is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Walsingham in 1909. It is found in Mexico (Guerrero) and the United States, where it has been recorded from Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, as well as in Puerto Rico.
The wingspan is about 12 mm. The forewings are blackish, the dorsum rich rosy reddish, this colour diffused upward along the termen and over the terminal cilia
through which runs a somewhat obscurely reduplicated dark shade-line. The hindwings are dark grey. Adults are on wing year round in Mexico.
The larvae feed on the shoot tips and young leaves of Acacia cornigera, Acacia farnesiana and Chamaecrista nictitans. They construct larval webs near the tips of the host plant.
