The white-throated thrush (Turdus assimilis) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae. It is found in Mexico and Central America, ranging south to central Panama. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is common in its range and an extremely rare vagrant into Texas and Arizona; 3 sightings have been recorded (1990 and 1998 in Texas and 2019 in Arizona).There are 13 subspecies, and the Dagua thrush (East Panama and South America) and white-necked thrush (South America) have sometimes also been included as subspecies.This species has been referred to in some literature as "white-throated robin." However, that name is now more usually applied to the European species Irania gutturalis.
