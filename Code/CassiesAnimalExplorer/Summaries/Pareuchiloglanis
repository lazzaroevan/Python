Pareuchiloglanis is a genus of sisorid catfishes native to Asia. These species are rheophilic catfish chiefly found in the headwaters of major rivers in South and East Asia. They originate from the Brahmaputra drainage in India, east and south to the Yangtze drainage in China and the Annamese Cordillera drainages in southern Vietnam. Two species are known from the Mekong River: P. myzostoma and P. gracilicaudata. Four species are known from the (upper Mekong River) drainage of China: P. abbreviatus, P. gracilicaudata, P. myzostoma and P. prolixdorsalis.
