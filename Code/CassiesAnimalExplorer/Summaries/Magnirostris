Magnirostris, from the Latin magnus "large" and rostrum "beak", is the name given to a genus of dinosaur from the upper Campanian stage in the Upper Cretaceous. It was a ceratopsian which lived in Inner Mongolia in China. It is distinguished from other protoceratopsids by its large beak (hence the name) and incipient orbital horn cores.
