The Magellanic diving-petrel (Pelecanoides magellani) is a species of diving petrel, one of five very similar, small, auk-like petrels found exclusively in the southern oceans. It is one of the smaller species of diving-petrels, though size differences are seemingly indistinguishable between species unless seen up close. It is probably the least known of all five species.
