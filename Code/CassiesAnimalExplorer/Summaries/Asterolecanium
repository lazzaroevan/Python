Asterolecanium is a genus of pit scale insects. Asterolecanium is distributed worldwide: species have been found in each of the six biogeographic realms, and nearly all of their respective subregions.Many species of Asterolecanium are destructive to crops and other plants of economic importance such as bamboo and oak, and are therefore considered pests. Asterolecanium species have been found on at least 37 plant families, most prominently Gramineae (grasses), Palmae (palm trees), and Fagaceae (beech trees). Some species prefer a single host, while others feed on multiple host species. Some feed only on a single part of a plant, such as leaves or stems, while others infest the whole plant. Some create pits in their hosts, depending on the susceptibility of the host plant to damage.
