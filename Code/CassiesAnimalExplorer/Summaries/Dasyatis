Dasyatis (Greek δασύς dasýs meaning rough or dense and βατίς batís meaning skate) is a genus of stingray in the family Dasyatidae that is native to the Atlantic, including the Mediterranean. In a 2016 taxonomic revision, many of the species formerly assigned to Dasyatis were reassigned to other genera (Bathytoshia, Fontitrygon, Hemitrygon, Hypanus, Megatrygon and Telatrygon).
