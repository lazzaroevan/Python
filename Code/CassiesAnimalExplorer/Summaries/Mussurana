Mussurana or musurana (Portuguese: mu√ßurana) is a common name which is used for several species of New World snakes, especially species in the genus Clelia. Clelia is a genus of large snakes in the family Colubridae.  The genus is endemic to Central America and South America, and species of Clelia are found from southern Mexico to Brazil. They specialize in ophiophagy, i.e., they attack and eat other snakes. Currently seven species are recognized as being valid. They have other popular names in various countries, such as zopilota in Central America and cribo on some Caribbean islands (though they are not related to Drymarchon).
