Asoriculus is an extinct genus in the shrew subfamily Soricinae endemic to Spain (A. gibberodon), Corsica (A. corsicanus), Sardinia (A. similis), and Sicily (A. burgioi) in the Mediterranean. The various species arrived on the islands soon after the start of the Pliocene, and systematically became extinct during the late Holocene, possibly due to human activities. Historically, there has been uncertainty about whether the closely related genus Nesiotites is separate from Asoriculus; a conservative approach that keeps the two genera separate isolates all species from the Balearic islands into Nesiotites.
