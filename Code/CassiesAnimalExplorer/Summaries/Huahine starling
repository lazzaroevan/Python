The Huahine starling (Aplonis diluvialis) is an extinct bird from the genus Aplonis within the starling family, Sturnidae. It was endemic to the island of Huahine, in the Society Islands of French Polynesia, and therefore had the easternmost distribution of all Aplonis species in the Pacific region.
