Stenoma zobeida is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931. It is found in Mexico and Panama.The wingspan is 17â€“19 mm. The forewings are light greyish ochreous with a triangular greyish-violet blotch from the dorsum at two-fifths reaching more than half across the wing, edged anteriorly towards the dorsum by a white line terminating in a small orange scale-projection and preceded by some greyish-violet dorsal suffusion, the apex of the blotch connected with the costa before one-third by a greyish-violet line. There is a transverse-oval dark fuscous whitish-edged blotch on the end of the cell and a curved greyish-violet line from the middle of the costa passing just beyond this to the dorsum at four-fifths, its lower half thickened into a fasciate blotch. There is a greyish-violet line from the costa at three-fourths to the dorsum before the tornus, thickened and sinuate inwards near the costa, the space between this and the preceding tinged whitish towards the costa. A grayish-violet marginal streak is found around the apex and termen, obscurely whitish edged anteriorly. The hindwings are grey.
