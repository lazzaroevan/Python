There is an ochreous-white spot in the disc slightly beyond the second of these, and a larger spot in disc at two-thirds, these more or less surrounded with black and united by a black blotch, opposite small cloudy whitish spots at three-fourths of the costa and tornus tending to unite into a straight line touching this.
