Creurgops is a genus of Neotropical birds in the tanager family Thraupidae. They are found in the canopy of humid montane forest in the Andes of South America.
These are relatively large and heavy-billed tanagers. They are mainly slaty grey above and rufous below, except in the male slaty tanager where the underparts also are slaty grey. Males of both species have a crown patch, which is lacking in the females. They commonly participate in mixed-species flocks.
