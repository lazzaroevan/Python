The Cyclosia Midamia is a moth, also called a mimic moth, out of the nominate species of the burnet moth (family: Zygaenidae, subfamily: Calcosiinae). It is extremely fascinating, considering its defense mechanism. It disguises itself to look like a butterfly called the spotted blue crow. It looks and acts just like this butterfly. It secretes a liquid called hydrogen cyanide that can be extremely poisonous and sometimes deadly. This can seriously harm humans. They excrete this out of their legs as little droplets. Though unlike the butterfly, and so many other insects, the Cyclosia Midamia produces its own poison made out of the chemical compound Cyanide. If a human ingests or touches enough Cyadine they could become seriously injured, and even die. So though these moths are pretty on the outside they arenâ€™t  on the inside. So don't touch.

Cyclosia midamia is a moth in the family Zygaenidae. It is found in Malaysia and on Borneo. Five subspecies recognized.
