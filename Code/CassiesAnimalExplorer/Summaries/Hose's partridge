Hose's partridge (Rhizothera dulitensis), also known as Dulit partridge, has been considered a distinctive subspecies of the long-billed partridge, a bird in the Phasianidae, or pheasant, family.  It is endemic to Borneo, where it appears to be separated altitudinally from the nominate subspecies, and is often considered now to be a full species, Rhizothera dulitensis.  It is little-known, rare, and has not been recorded since 1937.
