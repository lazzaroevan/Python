Galagadon () is an extinct genus of small carpet shark that lived during the Late Cretaceous period. It contains one species, G. nordquistae. It was named after the video game Galaga due to a resemblance between its teeth and the spaceships in the game, and Field Museum volunteer Karen Nordquist.The extinct shark would have traversed the rivers and wetlands of South Dakota some 67 million years ago. The find, dating to the late Cretaceous period, was presented in the Journal of Paleontology.
