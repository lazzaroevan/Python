Conus striatus, common name the striated cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.These snails are predatory and venomous. While they are piscivorous (eat fishes), they are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
