Draco is a genus of agamid lizards that are also known as flying lizards, flying dragons or gliding lizards. These lizards are capable of gliding flight; their ribs and their connecting membrane may be extended to create "wings" (patagia), the hindlimbs are flattened and wing-like in cross-section, and a flap on the neck (the gular flag) serves as a horizontal stabilizer and are sometimes used in warning to others. Draco are arboreal insectivores.
While not capable of powered flight they often obtain lift in the course of their gliding flights. Glides as long as 60 m (200 ft) have been recorded, over which the animal loses only 10 m (33 ft) in height, which is quite some distance, considering that one lizard is only around 20 cm (7.9 in) in total length, tail included. They are found in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and are fairly common in forests, areca gardens, teak plantations and shrub jungle.
