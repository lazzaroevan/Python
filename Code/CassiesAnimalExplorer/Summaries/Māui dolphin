Māui dolphin or popoto (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui) is a subspecies of the Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori)—New Zealand's only endemic cetacean species. Māui dolphin are only found off the west coast of New Zealand's North Island, and are now one of the rarest and smallest dolphin subspecies globally. The latest population size estimate for the Māui dolphin subspecies estimated 63 individuals of age one year or older (95% CL = 57, 75). Both the Māui dolphin and South Island Hector's dolphin are threatened by commercial fisheries, including set-netting and trawling, recreational netting, and disease including toxoplasmosis and brucellosis. Low food availability may also be an issue for Māui dolphin, which may increase their susceptibility to climate change.
