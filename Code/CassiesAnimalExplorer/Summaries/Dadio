The dadio (Laubuka dadiburjori) is a cyprinid fish, is rarely seen in the aquarist hobby but is not entirely unlike the Danio nigrofasciatus in appearance. Laubuka dadiburjori is a gold/silver fish with a blue line, it has two colour morphs, one with a distinct blue line, the other with a dotted blue line. Barbels are not present. Like most Danionins, this fish has a tendency to jump. A tight fitting lid with no gaps is recommended. Endemic in India, where both colour morphs co-exist, the fish is found from Tamil Nadu to Goa.
