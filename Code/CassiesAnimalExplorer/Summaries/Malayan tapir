The Malayan tapir (Acrocodia indica), also called the Asian tapir, Asiatic tapir, Oriental tapir, Indian tapir, or piebald tapir, is the largest of the four widely-recognized species of tapir, and the only one native to the Old World. The scientific name refers to the East Indies, the species' natural habitat. In the Malay language, it is commonly referred to as cipan, tenuk or badak tampung.
