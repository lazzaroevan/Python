Petrophora chlorosata, the brown silver-line, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his 1763 Entomologia Carniolica. It is found in Eurasia extending from Ireland and Britain to Asia Minor, northern Iran, the Altai mountains, Amdo, south eastern Siberia, and Japan.
The wingspan is 31–37 mm. The length of the forewings is 15–18 mm. Quite distinct from all other Palearctic species, the forewing light brown, the lines finely whitish, proximally dark shaded, subterminal line rather straight, sometimes indistinct.

The moth flies from the end of April to the end of June.[1]The caterpillars feed on bracken.
