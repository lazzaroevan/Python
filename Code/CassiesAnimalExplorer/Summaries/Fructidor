Fructidor (French pronunciation: ​[fʁyktidɔʁ]) is the twelfth month in the French Republican Calendar. The month was named after the Latin word fructus, which means "fruit".
Fructidor is the third month of the summer quarter (mois d'été). By the Gregorian calendar, Fructidor starts on either August 18 or August 19 and ends exactly thirty days later, on September 16 or September 17. Fructidor follows the month of Thermidor and precedes the Sansculottides. 
The month is often used as a shorthand term for the Coup of 18 Fructidor.
