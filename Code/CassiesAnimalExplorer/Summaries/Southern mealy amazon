The southern mealy amazon or southern mealy parrot (Amazona farinosa) is among the largest parrots in the genus Amazona, the amazon parrots. It is a mainly green parrot with a total length of 38–41 cm (15–16 in). It is endemic to tropical Central and South America. This species and the northern mealy amazon (Amazona guatemalae) were previously considered conspecific.  Some taxonomic authorities (including the American Ornithological Society), continue to lump them together.
