The sepia-brown wren or Sharpe's wren (Cinnycerthia olivascens) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Peruvian wren (C. peruana), but under the common name sepia-brown wren. As presently defined, the sepia-brown wren is found in dense undergrowth of humid Andean forests in Colombia, Ecuador, and northern Peru.
The common name commemorates the British zoologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe.
