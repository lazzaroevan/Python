Dracunculus medinensis, or Guinea worm, is a nematode that causes dracunculiasis, also known as guinea worm disease. The disease is caused by the female which, at up to 80 centimetres (31 inches) in length, is among the longest nematodes infecting humans. In contrast, the longest recorded male Guinea worm is only 4 cm (1 1‚ÅÑ2 in).The common name "guinea worm" is derived from the Guinea region of Western Africa.
