Ganisa pulupuluana is a moth in the family Eupterotidae. It was described by Wolfgang A. NÃ¤ssig, Nikolay N. Ignatyev and Thomas Joseph Witt in 2009. It is found on Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The wingspan is about 62 mm. The ground colour ranges from pale greyish brown to darker greyish brown. The pattern is variable, with the crenulate lines ranging from indistinct to strongly developed, or strong and combined with partially intense darkening of the ground colour. The hindwings are similar to the forewings, but the pattern is less distinct and there is no prominent postmedian line. There are probably multiple generations per year.
