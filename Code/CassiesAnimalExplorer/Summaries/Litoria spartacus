Litoria spartacus is a species of frogs in the family Pelodryadidae (alternatively Hylidae). It is endemic to New Guinea in Papua New Guinea and is only known from two localities within the Kikori Integrate Conservation and Development Project Area in the Southern Highlands Province. It has affinities to Litoria macki and Litoria spinifera but has a smaller size and more extensively webbed hands and less tuberculate body.
