The forewings are whitish grey with the costa and termen narrowly rather dark grey. From the dorsum near the base, a rather dark grey streak is found parallel to the costa to near the middle and there is a somewhat oblique-transverse streak of brown suffusion about the middle of the disc. The plical and second discal stigmata are moderate and blackish, a blackish dot above and before the latter, another beneath and beyond, and a few black specks around it.
