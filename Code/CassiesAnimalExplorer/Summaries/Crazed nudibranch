The crazed nudibranch, Corambe sp., as designated by Gosliner, 1987, is a species of sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusc in the superfamily Onchidoridoidea. It is also known as the moss animal nudibranch because its usual prey is a bryozoan, or moss animal. As at November 2009, it remained undescribed by science.
