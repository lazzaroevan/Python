Coleophora vestalella is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in France, Spain and Mallorca.
The larvae feed on Anthyllis cytisoides. They create a laterally strongly compressed lobe case with a mouth angle of about 45Â°. The mouth is shifted considerably to one side. The case consists of only two leaf fragments that closely fit and therefore do not extend out of the outline of the case. Most mines are found in the lower leaves. Full-grown larvae can be found from May to June.
