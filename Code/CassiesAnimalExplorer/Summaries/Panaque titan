Panaque titan  is a recently described species of freshwater fish from the South American armoured catfish family Loricariidae. It is known from several rivers in the Napo river basin, Ecuador, where it was perhaps first encountered in 1975. In the aquarium trade there are two forms of fish that resemble P. titan; Panaque sp. L191 from the Caqueta river, Colombia and Panaque sp. L418 from the Huallaga river, Peru.
