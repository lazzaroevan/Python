Pseudolividae is a taxonomic family of medium-sized sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Pseudolivoidea.The family name Pseudolividae is composed of the prefix "pseudo" and the word "Olividae" and thus means false olives. This refers to the fact that some of the species in this group, in particular a few of the Pseudoliva species, have shells that rather closely resemble those of the Olividae, the olives.
