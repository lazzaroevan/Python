It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland.The wingspan is about 18 mm (0.71 in). The forewings are whitish densely irrorated (speckled) with dark-fuscous. The markings are dark-fuscous edged with whitish. There is a spot on the base of the dorsum, a small median spot at one-fourth, another larger but less defined between this and the middle, a third at three-fourths, and a fourth at the apex, both rather large. There are five costal dots in the posterior two-thirds, as well as a fine subterminal line from the apical spot to the tornus. The hindwings are dark-grey.
