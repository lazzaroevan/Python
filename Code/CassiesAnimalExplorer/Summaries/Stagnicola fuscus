Stagnicola fuscus is a species of freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Lymnaeidae, the pond snails.
Correa et al. (2010) proposed that species of clade C2 (including Stagnicola fuscus) should all be called Lymnaea, according to the principle of priority of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). Then this species would be named Lymnaea fusca Pfeiffer, 1821.
