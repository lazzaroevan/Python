Drillia macilenta is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Drilliidae.The type described by Barnard (1969) is smaller than Turris (Surcula) macella (Melvill, 1923). Kilburn (1988) supposed that this species was an undescribed Inquisitor or Agladrillia. It is described in WoRMS as Agladrillia macella (Melvill, 1923) (original combination: Turris macella Melvill, 1923).
J.C. Melvill renamed in 1923 Surcula macilenta, as the preoccupied name had already been given to a Tertiary fossil species Murex macilenta as long ago as 1766 by Dr. Solander; later, in 1799, named by F. E. Edwards as Pleurotoma macilenta. For these reasons, Melvill renamed the species as Surcula macella.
