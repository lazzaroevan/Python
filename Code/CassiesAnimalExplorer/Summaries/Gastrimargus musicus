Gastrimargus musicus, the yellow-winged locust or yellow-winged grasshopper, is a common grasshopper in Australia. It only displays its yellow back wings in flight, when it also emits a loud clicking sound. When swarming, the adults become dark brown. They are sometimes confused with the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera), though the yellow winged locust is "stouter and larger".
