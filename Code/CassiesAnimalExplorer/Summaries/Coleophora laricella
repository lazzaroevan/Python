Coleophora laricella, the western larch case-bearer,  is a moth belonging to the family of case-bearing moths Coleophoridae. It is native to Central and Northern Europe, with its original food source being the European larch or Larix decidua. However, it was introduced to North America in the mid-19th century where it has gained a wide range and become an invasive defoliater of several species of the genus Larix, particularly the western larch Larix occidentalis and the tamarack larch Larix laricina.
