Protoxinjiangchelys is an extinct genus of basal pan-cryptodiran xinjiangchelyid turtle known from the Early to Late Jurassic of China (Xintiangou Formation and possibly also the Shaximiao Formation). It is known from the single species P. salis, which was named and described in 2012. It contains only the holotype, ZDM 3009, which consists of a complete shell with an articulated carapace and a complete plastron and possibly another, older specimen.
