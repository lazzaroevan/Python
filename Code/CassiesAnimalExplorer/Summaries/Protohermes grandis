Protohermes grandis is a large, colorful species of dobsonfly occurring in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.

â€œThe TDF for P.grandis larvae suggests that their low TPs in nature were caused by incorporation of vascular plant-derived amino acids (with a different N-15 profile from that of algae) and not by an unusually low TDF or by the effects of the satiation/starvation on amino acid metabolism.
