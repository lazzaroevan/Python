Phyllocnistis ampelopsiella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae, known from Qu√©bec and the United States (Colorado, Kentucky, Maine and New York).The hostplants for the species include Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Psedera quinquefolia, and Vitis vinifera. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a white, convoluted mine on the underside of the leaf. Although it is somewhat linear, it winds about from the midrib
to the margin and back, between the veins of the leaf until the entire cuticle in the mined portion is separated, and the mine becomes a blotch.
