Protobrama is an extinct genus of teleost fish from the Cretaceous period of Lebanon.
Protobrama was a small fish, only 15 centimetres (6 in) long, and is thought to have hunted around coral reefs. It had a deep body, with long dorsal and anal fins, but had no pelvic fin. The position of the pectoral fins high on the body suggests that it was probably a fairly agile fish.
