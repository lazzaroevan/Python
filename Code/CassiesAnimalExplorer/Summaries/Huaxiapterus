Huaxiapterus (meaning "Hua Xia [China] wing") is a genus of tapejarid pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Aptian-age Lower Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Chaoyang, Liaoning, China. It is the second genus of tapejarid from this formation, after Sinopterus.  Three species are known (H. jii, "H. corollatus", and "H. benxiensis"), though they may not actually form a natural group with each other. It was first named by LÃ¼ Junchang and Yuan Chongxi.
