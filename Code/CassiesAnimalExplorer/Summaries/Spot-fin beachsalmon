Leptobrama muelleri, also known as the Spot-fin beachsalmon is a species of perciform fish, primarily coastal marine or brackish water, fish found in tropical coastal waters of the Western Pacific off southern  New Guinea, Queensland and Western Australia. The beachsalmon is a popular sport fish in Australia, where it is sometimes called "flat salmon", "silver salmon", "slender bream" or "skippy" (a name also applied to several species of trevallies).Historically, Leptobrama was placed in the sweeper family Pempheridae; while the two are similar, they in fact have no more characteristics in common than "any other two arbitrarily chosen acanthopterygian forms might be expected to have," therefore justifying the placement of Leptobrama in its own family. The genus name Leptobrama may be translated from the Greek leptos, meaning "thin" and the Old French bresme, meaning "breme" or "freshwater fish", an allusion to its tendency to enter the mouths of rivers and estuaries.
