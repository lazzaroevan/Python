Paralobesia viteana, the grape berry moth, is a moth of the family Tortricidae, found in Eastern North America and western Colorado, where it is an important agricultural pest in vineyards. The synonym Endopiza viteana is frequently used in literature, but was replaced by Paralobesia viteana per J.W. Brown (2006).
