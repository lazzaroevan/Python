Ctenophorus maculosus, commonly known as the Lake Eyre dragon lizard or salt-lake ground-dragon, is a species of agamid lizard endemic to South Australia. C. maculosus mainly inhabits the edges of salt lakes in South Australia, from which its common names are derived. It survives in this harsh habitat through adaptive mechanisms to tolerate high temperatures and lack of free water.  The female C. maculosus possesses unique male rejection techniques which are currently the focus of further research.
