Stenoterommata palmar is a mygalomorph spider of Argentina, named after its type locality: Parque Nacional El Palmar, Entre Rios. Females differ from other three-clawed Stenoterommata in the spermathecae having one triangular dome with a single receptaculum arising from its base; males are most similar to those of S. tenuistyla, but lack short ventral spines on the metatarsus I (typical of that species), and have a long, curved spine on the apical third of their ventral tibia I. Its burrowing behaviour is similar to that of S. tenuistyla.
