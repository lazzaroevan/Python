Longicrusavis was a ground dwelling carvinore, a wader, and part of biological family Hongshanornithidae, considered to have been a dominant species in the Jehol Biota, the prehistoric Chinese ecosystem which supported them.  The name Hongshanornithidae represents one of Chinas oldest recorded cultures in the region, the Hongshan culture.
