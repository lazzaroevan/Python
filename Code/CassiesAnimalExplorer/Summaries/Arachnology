Arachnology is the scientific study of spiders and related animals such as scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and harvestmen, collectively called arachnids. Those who study spiders and other arachnids are arachnologists. More narrowly, the study of spiders alone (order Araneae) is known as araneology.The word "arachnology" derives from Greek ἀράχνη, arachnē, "spider"; and -λογία, -logia.
