The dusky leaf monkey, spectacled langur, or spectacled leaf monkey (Trachypithecus obscurus) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in peninsular Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand; however, dusky leaf monkeys have occasionally been observed in Singapore.  It is not clear whether these monkeys are escaped pets or whether they swam to Singapore on their own volition from Johor, Malaysia.
