Prodinoceras ("Before Terrible Horns") is the earliest known uintathere genus, which lived in the late Paleocene of Mongolia. It was a relatively small uintathere, reaching 2.9 m (9.5 ft) in length. It is also regarded as the most basal uintathere, as, although it had the characteristic fang-like tusks, it had yet to evolve the characteristic knob-like horns.
It is very similar to the North American Probathyopsis, which experts regard as its sister genus.
