Phyllonorycter abrasella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is found from the Czech Republic and Slovakia to France, Italy and Greece. There is a disjunct population in southern Russia.

The larvae feed on Quercus cerris. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a rather small, lower-surface tentiform mine, generally in the centre of the leaf. There are fine folds in the lower epidermis, and the upperside is mottled green. The frass is deposited in a clump. The pupa is made in an oval, parchment-like cocoon that is free of frass and lies loose in the mine.
