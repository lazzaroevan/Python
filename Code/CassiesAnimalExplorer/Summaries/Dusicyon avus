Dusicyon avus is an extinct species of canid in the genus Dusicyon, native to South America during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. It was medium to large, about the size of a German shepherd. It was closely related to the warrah or Falkland Islands wolf, and was the ancestral species from which it diverged. It appears to have survived until very recently, perhaps 400 years ago.
