Draco dussumieri or Indian flying lizard, is a species of agamid lizard capable of gliding from tree to tree. It is found principally in the Western Ghats and some other hill forests of Southern India. They are almost completely arboreal, found on trees in forests and adjoining palm plantations where they climb trees to forage for insects and glide to adjoining trees by expanding the patagium, loose skin on the sides of the body which are supported by elongated ribs to act as wings. The skin on the sides of the neck are also extended to the sides using the hyoid bones of the tongue to support them. During the breeding season males maintain small territories which they defend from other males while courting females. Males have a more colourful patagium than females and they prominently extend their yellow dewlaps forward in display. Although living almost their entire lives on the trees, females descend to the ground to lay eggs in soil. This is the species with the westernmost distribution within the genus Draco, the majority of species occurring in Southeast Asia.
