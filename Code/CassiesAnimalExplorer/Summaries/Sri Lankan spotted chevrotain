Moschiola meminna is a species of even-toed ungulate in the chevrotain family (Tragulidae). Particularly in the old literature, M. meminna often refers to the spotted chevrotains as a whole. Today, the name is increasingly restricted to the Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain or white-spotted chevrotain, with the Indian spotted chevrotain M. indica and/or the yellow-striped chevrotain M.  kathygre treated as distinct species. 
In Sri Lanka, this species is found in the dry zone and is replaced in the wet zone by the yellow-striped chevrotain.
