Aquiloeurycea scandens, commonly known as the Tamaulipas false brook salamander, is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Mexico and known from the El Cielo Biosphere in southern Tamaulipas. There are also reports from San Luis Potos√≠ and Coahuila, but these may well refer to other, as yet unnamed species.Its natural habitat is caves. Within the El Cielo Biosphere its habitat is well protected. It was once fairly common, but has not been seen after mid-1980s. Whether this reflects a genuine decline or low survey effort is not known.
