Palorchestes selestiae is a fossil species of Diprotodontidae, ancient mammals that existed in Australia.
The description of the species by B. S. Mackness was published in 1995, emerging from a study of a left first molar found at the Allingham formation of the Bluff Downs fossil site. The specific epithet is derived from Selesti Smith, a resident of Bluff Downs Station.
The size of the holotype, a molar, was around three-quarters that of P. azael, the most recent taxon of the genus, and one-fifth larger than P. parvus. The morphology of the tooth resembles the later species, although the size is much closer to smaller congener P. parvus.
