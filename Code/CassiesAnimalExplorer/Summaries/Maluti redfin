The Maluti redfin (Pseudobarbus quathlambae) is a ray-finned fish species in the family Cyprinidae. It is colloquially called the Maluti minnow, but it is not a true minnow.
It is Lesotho's only endemic freshwater fish, and threatened by the impact of invasive species, such as Smallmouth yellowfish.
