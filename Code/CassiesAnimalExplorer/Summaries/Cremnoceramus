Cremnoceramus ("cremno-" = kremnos [Greek]: precipice or over hanging wall or bank; "ceramus" = keramos [Greek]: clay pot) is an extinct genus of fossil marine pteriomorphian bivalves that superficially resembled the related winged pearly oysters of the extant genus Pteria. They lived from the Turonian to the Maastrichtian of the Late Cretaceous.
