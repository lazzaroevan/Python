Corythomantis greeningi, occasionally called Greening's frog, is a venomous frog species in the family Hylidae. Endemic to eastern Brazil, it lives in Caatinga habitat. It is usually situated on vegetation, including in bromeliads, and on rock outcrops. Breeding occurs in temporary streams. Although suffering from habitat loss, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN. The specific name greeningi was in honour of Linnaeus Greening (1855-1927), an English businessman and naturalist known for his work on arachnids, reptiles and amphibians.
