Cornufer wolfi is a species of frog in the family Ceratobatrachidae. It is endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago and known from the Buka and Bougainville Islands in Papua New Guinea and from the Santa Isabel and Choiseul Islands in the Solomon Islands. The specific name wolfi honours Eugen Wolf, a member of the Hanseatische SÃ¼dsee-Expedition (1909) and writer of the expedition's travel report. Common name Wolf's sticky-toed frog has been coined for it.
