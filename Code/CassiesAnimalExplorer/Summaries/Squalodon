Squalodon is an extinct genus of whales of the Oligocene and Miocene epochs, belonging to the family Squalodontidae. Named by Jean-Pierre Sylvestre de Grateloup in 1840, it was originally believed to be an iguanodontid dinosaur but has since been reclassified. The name Squalodon comes from Squalus, a genus of shark.  As a result, its name means "shark tooth." Its closest modern relative is the South Asian river Dolphin (with its two subspecies the Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin).
