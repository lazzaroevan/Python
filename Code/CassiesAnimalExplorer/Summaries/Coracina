Coracina is a large genus of birds in the cuckooshrike family Campephagidae.
The genus was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The type species was subsequently designated as the white-bellied cuckooshrike (Coracina papuensis) by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850â€“1851. The name Coracina is from the Ancient Greek korakinos meaning "little raven", a diminutive of korax meaning "raven".The genus formerly included many more species. It was split based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010. A major clade was moved to the resurrected genus Edolisoma and a smaller group of Asian and Indian Ocean species moved to the genus Lalage.The genus contains the following 22 species:
