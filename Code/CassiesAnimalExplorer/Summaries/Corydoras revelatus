Corydoras revelatus is an extinct species of callichthyid catfish known from a single specimen found in Late Paleocene strata of the Mais Gordo Formation in Salta, Argentina. According to chronological dating of the strata, the fossil specimen is about 58.2â€“58.5 million years old.
Compared to modern species, C. revelatus has a short, comparatively rounded head, and rather low-set eyes.  Although the species's position within the genus Corydoras is tentative and unresolved, its anatomy confirms that it is a member of the subfamily, Corydoradinae, and demonstrates that the callichthyids had already diverging or diversifying before the end of the Paleocene.
