Marionfyfea adventor is a species of land planarian described in 2016 from specimens found in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France. However, since the species belongs to the genus Marionfyfea, of which the species are known only from subantarctic islands off New Zealand, it is probably an introduced species in Europe.
