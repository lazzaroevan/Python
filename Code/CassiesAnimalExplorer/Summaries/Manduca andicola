It is found from Central America to Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Argentina.It is similar to Manduca lefeburii, Manduca incisa and Manduca jasminearum in having a relatively uniform forewing upperside with a conspicuous, rather diffuse dark band running from about midway along the costa to the outer margin and incorporating the discal spot.
Adults fly as three generations in the subequatorial zone, with adults on wing from December to January, May to June and in October.
The larvae feed on plants in the family Annonaceae.
