Cyathaspidida is a taxon of extinct cyathaspidiform heterostracan agnathans whose fossils are found in Silurian to Lower Devonian marine strata of Europe and North America.  In life, they are thought to be benthic animals that lived most of their lives either mostly buried in or resting directly on top of the substrate.
