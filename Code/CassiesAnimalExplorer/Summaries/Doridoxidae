Doridoxidae, commonly known as doridoxid nudibranchs, are a small, enigmatic taxonomic family of shell-less sea slugs, marine  gastropod molluscs in the clade Cladobranchia within the clade Nudibranchia.Doridoxidae is currently the only family in the superfamily Doridoxoidea, within the clade Pseudoeuctenidiacea (= Doridoxida). Molecular evidence shows that it groups with the genera Doridomorpha and Heterodoris and the family Arminidae and close to Tritoniidae.
