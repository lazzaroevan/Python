Colomesus asellus, the Amazon puffer, asellus puffer, South American freshwater puffer or Peruvian puffer is a species of pufferfish confined to the Amazon, Essequibo and Orinoco basins in tropical South America. It is a popular aquarium species.It has typically been recognized as the only true freshwater pufferfish of South America, but a study in 2013 recommended that the population in the Tocantins River basin (quite similar to C. asellus in appearance, but differs in genetics) should be considered as a separate species, C. tocantinensis. This is followed by Catalog of Fishes, but not FishBase.
