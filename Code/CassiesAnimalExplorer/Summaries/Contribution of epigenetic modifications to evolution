Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that occur via mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and microRNA modification. When these epigenetics changes are heritable, they can influence evolution.  Current research indicates that epigenetics has influenced evolution in a number of organisms, including plants and animals.
