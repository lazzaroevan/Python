Spectrolebias is a genus of killifish in the family Rivulidae. These annual killifish are endemic to seasonal waters (like pools) in the Paraguay, Tocantins–Araguaia, Xingu and Mamoré–Grande basins in Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Each species generally has a small distribution and some are seriously threatened by habitat loss; the entire known range of S. reticulatus is in the area flooded by the Belo Monte Dam.They are small fish, up to 6 cm (2.4 in) in total length. As typical of killifish, males are more colorful than females.
