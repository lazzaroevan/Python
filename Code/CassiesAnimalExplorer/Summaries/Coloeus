Coloeus is a genus of bird that is sometimes treated as a subgenus of Corvus, including by the IUCN. It contains two relatively small species both named "jackdaws". They have a blackish crown, wings and tail, the rest of the plumage being paler. The word Coloeus is New Latin, from the Ancient Greek for jackdaws: koloiós (κολοιός).
