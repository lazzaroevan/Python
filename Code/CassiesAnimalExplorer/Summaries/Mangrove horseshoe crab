The mangrove horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda), also known as the round-tailed horseshoe crab, is a chelicerate arthropod found in tropical marine and brackish waters in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Hong Kong. It may also occur in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Philippines, but confirmed records are lacking.Despite their name, horseshoe crabs are more closely related to spiders and scorpions (all are in the subphylum Chelicerata) than to crabs. Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that horseshoe crabs may themselves be arachnids. The mangrove horseshoe crab is the only species in the genus Carcinoscorpius.  There are four extant (living) species of horseshoe crab. The biology, ecology and breeding patterns of C. rotundicauda and the two other Asian horseshoe crab species, Tachypleus gigas and Tachypleus tridentatus, have not been as well documented as those of the North American species Limulus polyphemus. All four extant species of horseshoe crabs are anatomically very similar, but C. rotundicauda is considerably smaller than the others and the only species where the cross section of the tail (telson) is rounded instead of essentially triangular.
