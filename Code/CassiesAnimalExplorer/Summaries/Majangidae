The Majangidae are a revived (2019) family of praying mantids from Madagascar. 
As part of a major revision of mantid taxonomy, this family consists of genera in two subfamilies previously placed in the Liturgusidae (Majanginae) and Deroplatyinae.  The new placement means that this taxon is part of the superfamily Epaphroditoidea (of the clade Cernomantodea) and infraorder Schizomantodea.
