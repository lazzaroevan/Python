Lophocoronoidea is a superfamily of insects in the order Lepidoptera. There is a single genus, Lophocorona, in the family Lophocoronidae. These are small, primitive nocturnal moths restricted to Australia whose biology is largely unknown (Common, 1990; Kristensen and Nielsen, 1996; Kristensen, 1999).
