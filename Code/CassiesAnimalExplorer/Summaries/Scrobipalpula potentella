Scrobipalpula potentella is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Keifer in 1936. It is found in the United States, where it has been recorded from California, Mississippi and Tennessee.The wingspan is 9â€“11 mm. The forewings are dull whitish covered by general dark fuscous irroration (speckling) and some inconspicuous ocherous longitudinal streaks. There is an ocherous streak within the costa from the base to nearly halfway. There is also an ocherous streak in the plication to the plical stigma at one-third. The stigmata are usually distinct as blackish dots, with the first discal slightly beyond the plical and the second discal at about two-thirds, both more or less associated with ocherous. The hindwings are light gray.
The larvae feed on Potentilla species. They mine the leaves of their host plant, usually tying and mining a succession of leaflets along the leafstalk.
