Maratus volans is a species in the jumping spider family (Salticidae), belonging to the genus Maratus (peacock spiders). These spiders are native to certain areas in Australia and occupy a wide distribution of habitats. They have a specialized visual system that allows them to see the full visible spectrum as well as in the UV-range; this helps them detect and pursue prey. Males of this species are characterized by their colorful abdomen flaps that are used to attract females during courtship.
