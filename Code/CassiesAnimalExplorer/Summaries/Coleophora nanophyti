Coleophora nanophyti is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in southern Russia, Turkestan and Uzbekistan.
The larvae feed on Nanophyton erinaceum. They create a silky, compact case with a sandy cover inside the fruit. The valve is three-sided and very short. The length of the case is 4.5–5 mm (0.18–0.20 in). In spring, after the sandy cover is completed during hibernation, the color of the case turns whitish-gray. The larvae can be found from September to October.
