The many-banded krait (Bungarus multicinctus), also known as the Taiwanese krait or the Chinese krait, is a venomous species of elapid snake found in much of central and southern China and Southeast Asia. The species was first described by the scientist Edward Blyth in 1861. The many-banded krait mostly inhabits marshy areas throughout its geographical distribution, though it does occur in other habitat types.
