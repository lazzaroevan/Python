Furileusauria ("stiff back lizards") is an extinct clade of derived abelisaurid dinosaurs only known from South American fossil remains. They represent some of the largest members of the Abelisauridae, with an average length of 7.1 ± 2.1 m (23.3 ± 6.9 ft). The clade is defined as the most inclusive clade containing Carnotaurus sastrei but not Ilokelesia aguadagrandensis, Skorpiovenator bustingorryi, or Majungasaurus crenatissimus.
