Aromobates, sometimes known as the skunk frogs, is a genus of frogs from the Andes of Venezuela and Colombia. Originally a monotypic genus consisting of the skunk frog, Aromobates nocturnus alone, it was later expanded to include Nephelobates. These frogs are difficult to differentiate from Allobates without using molecular markers.
