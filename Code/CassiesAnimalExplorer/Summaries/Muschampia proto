Muschampia proto, the sage skipper, is a butterfly of the  family Hesperiidae. It is found in Morocco, Algeria, the Iberian Peninsula, southern France, Italy, Sicily, Greece and in North Macedonia.

The length of the forewings is 14–15 mm, although there are specimens with a forewing length of 15–17 mm in Morocco. This is a rather variable species but usually has a well-marked central spot on the forewing to distinguish it from similar species. Adults are on wing in April, May or even later in one generation.
The larvae feed on Phlomis species.
