Stigmella scintillans is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in North America in Ohio, Michigan and Ontario.

There are usually two generations per year. Second-generation larvae are found in July and early August. These normally overwinter. At times, a third generation occurs, with larvae in late August.
The larvae feed on Crataegus species, including Crataegus mollis. They mine the leaves of their host plant.
