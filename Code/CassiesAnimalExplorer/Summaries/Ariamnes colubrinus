Ariamnes colubrinus, known as the whip spider, is a common Australian spider belonging to the family Theridiidae. It is found in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.
A small thin spider resembling a twig. Often found resting on one or two threads of silk. It eats wandering spiders, mostly juveniles (and some insects). The whip spider waits above the few strands of silk of its snare. When a small wandering spider hits the silk, this causes the whip spider to descend. The whip spider uses the "comb foot" of its end segment of the last pair of legs to wrap the meal in silk.
