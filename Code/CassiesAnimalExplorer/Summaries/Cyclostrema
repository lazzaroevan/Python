Cyclostrema is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Liotiidae.Cyclostrema is a neuter word, but many authors have considered it feminine, including Captain Marryat himself.
A complete revision of the family Liotiidae is under way (2013). Many species, now included in Cyclostrema, will eventually end up outside the family Liotiidae. (pers. comm.)
