Archaeolamna is an extinct genus of mackerel shark from the Cretaceous period. There are currently two named species, one of which has two named subspecies. Its isolated teeth have been found in Europe, North America, and Australia. A single associated dentition is known from the Pierre Shale of Kansas, USA. The grasping-type dentition and large size of these teeth suggest a diet of mainly large fish and possibly sea reptiles. There is some evidence of scavenging upon Plesiosaurs in the Judith River Formation.
