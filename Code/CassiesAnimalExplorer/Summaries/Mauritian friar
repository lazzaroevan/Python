The Mauritian friar (Amauris phoedon) is a species of nymphalid butterfly in the Danainae subfamily. It is endemic to Mauritius.Adults have been recorded imbibing exudations from the ends of broken branches of Tournefortia argentea lying on the ground, presumably for the pyrrolizidine alkaloids that may be present in the exudations.
The larvae feed on Tylophora asthmatica.
