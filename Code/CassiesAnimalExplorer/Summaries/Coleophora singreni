Coleophora singreni is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in southern Russia, Turkestan and Uzbekistan.
The larvae feed on Astragalus and Ammodendron species. They create a silky, sheath-like case without a cover. The caudal end is slightly down-curved. There are oblique pubescent wrinkles on the surface and sometimes also small blackish patches along the sides of these wrinkles. The valve is two-sided. The length of the case is 12.5â€“15 mm and it is dull white in color. Larvae can be found at the beginning of June and (after diapause) from April to the beginning of May.
