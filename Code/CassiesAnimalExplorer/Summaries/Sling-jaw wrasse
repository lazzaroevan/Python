The slingjaw wrasse, Epibulus insidiator, is a species of wrasse from the family labridae which is native to the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific where it occurs around coral reefs. This species is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries and can be found in the aquarium trade. Relatively unassuming at first glance, this fish is notable for its highly protrusible jaws.
