Stenoma amphitera is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1913. It is found in Peru.The wingspan is about 25 mm. The forewings are dark purplish fuscous with a light brownish blotch occupying the basal fourth of the costa, crossed near the base by a dark fuscous shade, terminated posteriorly by a small black costal mark, and including a blackish dash in its lower portion. Two ochreous-whitish dots are found above and below the fold at one-fourth and there is a white dot indicating the plical stigma, and an ochreous-whitish ring resting on the dorsum beneath this. There is an indistinct very oblique brownish line from a slight whitish mark on the costal edge beyond the basal blotch to an obscure brownish cloud in the disc beyond the middle, followed on the costa by a very narrow flattened-triangular blackish mark. A whitish mark is found on the costa at two-thirds, and a group of fine whitish dots beneath this. There are traces of a curved series of darker dots accompanied with some whitish scales running from these to tornus, and a suffused brownish streak around the apical margin, as well as some indistinct whitish terminal dots separated by darker spots. The hindwings are rather dark fuscous.
