Ctenoides scaber, the flame scallop or rough fileclam, is a species of saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Limidae. Despite their common name, flame scallops are not closely related to true scallops.
This species is found in the Caribbean Sea. It is similar in appearance to the Indo-Pacific electric flame scallop (Ctenoides ales).
