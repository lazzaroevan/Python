The mangrove hummingbird (Amazilia boucardi) is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is found only in Costa Rica. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forest. It is threatened by habitat loss. The mangrove hummingbird feeds primarily on nectar from the flowers of the tea mangrove Pelliciera rhizophorae. Mangrove hummingbirds are occasionally seen in adjacent non-mangrove habitats. Nesting for these birds has been recorded during the months of October through February. The mangrove hummingbird is on average approximately 10 cm (3.9 in) long.
