Double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA viruses) are a polyphyletic group of viruses that have double-stranded genomes made of ribonucleic acid. The double-stranded genome is used to transcribe a positive-strand RNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The positive-strand RNA may be used as messenger RNA (mRNA) which can be translated into viral proteins by the host cell's ribosomes. The positive-strand RNA can also be replicated by the RdRp to create a new double-stranded viral genome.Double-stranded RNA viruses are classified in two separate phyla Duplornaviricota and Pisuviricota (specifically class Duplopiviricetes), which are in the kingdom Orthornavirae and realm Riboviria. The two groups do not share a common dsRNA virus ancestor. Double-stranded RNA viruses evolved two separate times from positive-strand RNA viruses. In the Baltimore classification system, dsRNA viruses belong to Group III.Virus group members vary widely in host range (animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria), genome segment number (one to twelve), and virion organization (T-number, capsid layers, or turrets). Double-stranded RNA viruses include the rotaviruses, known globally as a common cause of gastroenteritis in young children, and bluetongue virus, an economically significant pathogen of cattle and sheep. The family Reoviridae is the largest and most diverse dsRNA virus family in terms of host range.
