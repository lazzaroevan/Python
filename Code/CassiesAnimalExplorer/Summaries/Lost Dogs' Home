The Lost Dogs’ Home is an Australian organisation with shelters and pounds in Victoria.  It was established in 1910 to provide a temporary home for Melbourne’s lost and starving dogs. Today The Lost Dogs’ Home cares for more than twenty-one thousand lost, stray, injured and abandoned dogs and cats every year and is Australia's largest animal shelter. They also host services and initiatives to promote animal welfare and responsible pet ownership. These people who work for this organisation want to take care of these poor animals to make them strong and ready for an owner to come adopt them.
