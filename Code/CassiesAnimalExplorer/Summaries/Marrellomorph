Marrellomorphs are a group of arthropods known from the Cambrian to the Early Devonian. They lacked mineralised hard parts, so are only known from areas of exceptional preservation, limiting their fossil distribution. They look like the Marrella, from the Burgess Shale. Recent research has shown the previously enigmatic Skania belongs to this group. They have either been interpreted as stem-mandibulates or more basal than or closer to Artiopoda.
