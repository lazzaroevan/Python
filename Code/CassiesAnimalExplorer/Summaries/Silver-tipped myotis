The silver-tipped myotis (Myotis albescens) is a species of mouse-eared bat found in a range of lowland habitats in the Americas.
It is part of the vesper bat genus Myotis, which includes many common species across the world. Genetic analysis suggests that it is probably most closely related to a group of Neotropical Myotis species that includes Myotis nigricans, Myotis levis, and Myotis oxyotus, or alternatively to Myotis dominicensis alone.
