Daeodon is an extinct genus of entelodont artiodactyl that inhabited North America between 29 and 15.97 million years ago during the middle Oligocene and early Miocene epochs. It had a broad distribution across the United States, but it was never abundant. The type species is Daeodon shoshonensis, the last and possible largest of the entelodonts; known adults of this species possessed skulls about 90 cm (3 ft) in length.
Another huge member of this family, similar in size and morphology to Daeodon, is the Asian Paraentelodon but it is known by very incomplete material.
