Parasphendale affinis, given the common name budwing mantis, named because of the female's short wings, is a species of praying mantis. They can grow to 4 inches long and have a low mortality rate as nymphs. They originate from Kenya and are always a mottled brown and reddish pink color. They have a voracious appetite, and have been known to gorge themselves to the point of illness when kept in captivity with an unlimited food source. Due to their level of activity, though they can be kept in captivity, they require more space than other mantis species.
