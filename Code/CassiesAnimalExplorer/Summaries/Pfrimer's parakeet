Pfrimer's parakeet (Pyrrhura pfrimeri) is a non-migratory species within the parrot family Psittacidae. It also is known as Pfrimer's conure, Goias parakeet, and maroon-faced conure. The Pfrimer's parakeet has been qualified as endangered by the IUCN and BirdLife International since 2007.  It is endemic to the Goiás and Tocantins regions of Brazil. It is mainly found within a belt of dry deciduous and semi-deciduous areas of the Caatinga forest.It was considered a subspecies of the white-eared parakeet, as Pyrrhura leucotis pfrimeri. The split was based on range, differences in habitat and distinctive differences in plumage (it is the only member of the P. leucotis complex where the pale patch on the ear-coverts is greatly reduced). A recent study based on mtDNA has confirmed its status as a distinct species. 
The population of Pfrimer's parakeet is currently decreasing, with a current population of between 20,000–49,000 individuals. The main factor behind the decreasing population is deforestation for agriculture.Individuals have an average lifespan of 6–8 years.
