A huarizo is a cross between a male llama and a female alpaca. The most common hybrid between South American camelids, huarizo tend to be much smaller than llamas, with their fibre being longer. Huarizo are sterile in the wild, but recent genetic research conducted at the  University of Minnesota Rochester suggests that it may be possible to preserve fertility with minimal genetic modification.
