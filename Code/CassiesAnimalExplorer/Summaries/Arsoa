Arsoa is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It was first established by the French entomologist LÃ©on Fairmaire in 1901, for two species described from Androy Plateau, in southern Madagascar. Adult males in the genus have very long forelegs.
The genus was originally placed by Fairmaire in the family Clythridae (now known as the tribe Clytrini). However, Martin Jacoby later determined that it actually belonged to Eumolpinae, and placed it near Abirus.
