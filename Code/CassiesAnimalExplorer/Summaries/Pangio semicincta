Pangio semicincta is a species of cobitid loach in the genus Pangio found in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Sumatra. It is a very popular fish in the aquarium trade, however it is often confused for and mislabeled as Pangio kuhlii, which is rarely if ever found in the aquarium trade due to it being endemic to the island of Java, where collection for the fish trade is rare.
