Spiruridae is family of nematodes in the order Spirurida. An unidentified parasitic larval member of this family has been recorded in the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in a salt marsh at Cedar Key, Florida, and also in fiddler crabs (Uca) there; it is perhaps a bird parasite that does not reach maturity in the rice rat.
