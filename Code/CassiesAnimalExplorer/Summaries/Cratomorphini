The Cratomorphini are a disputed tribe of fireflies of the large subfamily Lampyrinae. The genera placed here often contain well-sized members of their family. The larvae of many species climb trees to feed on snails. This group contains a few "lightning bugs" (flashing fireflies) from North America, e.g. the genus Pyractomena. Further south in the American tropics, Aspisoma can be found, but this is very doubtfully placed here.This is apparently a paraphyletic group, assembling ancient lineages of the Lampyrinae. The eventual fate of this group is not known; pending resolution of the affinities of the type genus Cratomorphus, it might be disassembled or persist without some genera which are closer to other tribes.
