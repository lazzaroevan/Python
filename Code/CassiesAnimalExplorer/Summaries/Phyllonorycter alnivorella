Phyllonorycter alnivorella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is found in France and Portugal.
The larvae feed on Alnus glutinosa. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They create a lower-surface tentiform mine, that is flat, roundish and mostly far from the midrib, but near the leaf margin. The cocoon is yellow.
