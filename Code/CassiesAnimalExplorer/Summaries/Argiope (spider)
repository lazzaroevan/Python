The genus Argiope includes rather large spiders that often have a strikingly coloured abdomen.  These spiders are distributed throughout the world.  Most countries in tropical or temperate climates host one or more species that are similar in appearance.  The etymology of Argiope is from a Latin word argentum meaning silver. The carapace of Argiope species is typically covered in silvery hairs, and when crawling in the sun, they reflect it in a way that gives them a metallic, white appearance.
