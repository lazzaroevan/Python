Solanderia ericopsis is a hydroid in the family Solanderiidae, the group commonly known as tree hydroids or sea fan hydroids. S. ericopsis forms very large, conspicuous colonies from 5 to 50 cm in height, which are often noted by divers. They are usually strictly fan-shaped but can sometimes be bushy.The colonies can be unusually long-lived: during long-term monitoring of defined rock areas around the Poor Knights Islands, one researcher observed a single colony of S. ericopsis over fifteen years, during which it reached 50 cm in height.
