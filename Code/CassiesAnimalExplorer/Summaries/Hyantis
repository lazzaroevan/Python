Hyantis is a monotypic nymphalid butterfly genus in the subfamily Morphinae. Its sole species is Hyantis hodeva, which is a Taenaris-mimic. 
Due to recent molecular analysis (Pe√±a et al.) and differences in both wing venation structure and larval morphology, it is clear that Hyantis is different from the other members of the Amathusiini, however its placement in Elymniini is uncertain.
