The pearlyâ€“bellied seedeater (Sporophila pileata) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae.  It was lumped with the copper seedeater, (S. bouvreuil) and known together as the capped seedeater before being split in February 2012.
It is found in southern Brazil, Paraguay, northern Uruguay and northeastern Argentina. Its natural habitat is dry savanna.
All capuchinos (as they are known in Spanish), including the pearly-bellied seedeater, are experiencing severe population declines due to illegal trapping for pet trade and loss of natural habitats, as a result of grasslands being used for agricultural uses.
