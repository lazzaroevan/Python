Lyperobius huttoni (known as Hutton's speargrass weevil, or simply speargrass weevil) is a New Zealand weevil found in alpine areas of the South Island and at sea level around the Wellington coast. It feeds only on speargrass (Aciphylla). Weevils from the endangered Wellington population have been translocated to predator-free Mana Island.
