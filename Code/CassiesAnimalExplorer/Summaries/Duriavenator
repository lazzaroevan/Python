Duriavenator is a genus of theropod dinosaur described in 2008 by Roger Benson; its finds were excavated in England. The only named species in the genus is Duriavenator hesperis, formerly known as Megalosaurus hesperis. Duriavenator lived during the Bajocian stage, between 169.1 and 168.7 million years ago, making it one of the oldest-known Tetanurae. The genus name combines the Latin name of Dorset, Duria, with Latin for "hunter", venator. This genus has also gone under the unofficial name "Walkersaurus", which is a nomen nudum. It has been estimated to be 7 meters (23 feet) in length.
