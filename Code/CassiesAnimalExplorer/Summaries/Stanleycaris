Stanleycaris is an extinct, monotypic genus of anomalocaridid which existed in Canada, during the middle Cambrian (Miaolingian). The type species is Stanleycaris hirpex. Stanleycaris was described from the Stephen Formation near the Stanley Glacier Burgess Shale locality and also informally reported from Odaray Mountain.The original description of the taxon appeared in an online supplement to the article published by Jean-Bernard Caron, Robert R. Gaines, M. Gabriela Mángano, Michael Streng and Allison C. Daley in 2010. That description did not satisfy of the requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, as the Code did not accept taxa named in electronic publications as validly named until 2012; the name was eventually validated by Pates, Daley & Ortega-Hernández (2018).Its one- to three-centimetre-long appendages are the most commonly found component, and comprise eleven podomeres with a row of steeply-angled double-pointed spines on their upper surface, and five curved, spiny blades protruding from the inner surface. Aside from the double-pointed spines, the appendages resemble those of Hurdia or Peytoia in their overall form. Peytoias are sometimes associated with the appendages; these have a square central opening. One specimen also appears to include an associated Hurdia-like carapace.Putative lobopodian species Aysheaia prolata from the Cambrian Wheeler Formation (Utah, United States) was reinterpreted as an isolated frontal appendage of a member of the genus Stanleycaris by Pates, Daley & Ortega-Hernández (2017).
