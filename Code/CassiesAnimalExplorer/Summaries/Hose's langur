Hose's langur (Presbytis hosei) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae endemic to the island of Borneo, including Brunei, Kalimantan (Indonesia), and East Malaysia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. It was first identified in Kutai National Park and Sangkulirang Peninsula, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 1985.
Miller's langur (P. canicrus) and the Saban grizzled langur (P. sabana) were previously considered subspecies of Hose's langur.  There used to also be two additional forms that were considered separate subspecies, P. h. hosei and P. h. everetti.  However, P. h. everetti is no longer considered to be a separate subspecies as the original identification of it as a separate subspecies appears to be the result of comparing a subadult female with an adult male.
