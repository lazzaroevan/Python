Steinernema scapterisci, the mole cricket nematode, is a species of nematode in the order Rhabditida. It is a parasite of insects in the order Orthoptera, the grasshoppers, crickets and their allies. Native to southern South America, it was introduced into Florida in the United States in an effort to provide a biological control of pest (Neoscapteriscus) mole crickets.
A second species of "mole cricket nematode" exists in Florida, and probably elsewhere in the eastern USA. It is now called Steinernema neocurtillae Nguyen,Smart, and is known to attack only the native mole cricket Neocurtilla hexadactyla
