Paratilapia polleni is a medium-sized cichlid endemic to Madagascar. It is also a popular fish for display at public aquaria.It is sometimes referred to by the common names polleni cichlid and black diamond cichlid, while the name marakely (black fish) is used among locals in Madagascar.  This species is probably the only known member of its genus, as its current congener, P. toddi, from the African mainland, is unlikely to belong to this genus. Its specific name honours Fran√ßois Pollen (1842-1888), a Dutch naturalist and merchant, who collected the type when visiting Madagascar with fellow Dutch naturalist and explorer Douwe Casparus van Dam (1827-1898).
