Palmichnium ("palm trace") is an ichnofossil genus, interpreted as a eurypterid trackway. It has been found by many places around the world, such as Australia, Canada, United States or Wales.
Its trackways consist of three or four subcircular tracks that are symmetrical around a midline impression that is arranged en echelon with a high angle to the midline.
