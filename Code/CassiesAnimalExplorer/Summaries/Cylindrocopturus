Cylindrocopturus is a genus of weevil in the tribe Zygopini. It was initially described by Heller in 1895. Although included in the Lechriopini by some early sources, it has been included in the Zygopini in all more recent works. Species in Cylindrocopturus have an unmodified mesoventrite and do not have sclerolepidia. Two Cylindrocopturus species, C. eatoni and C. furnissi, are considered pests.
