Dactylethrella candida is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Stainton in 1859. It is found in Sri Lanka and southern India.The wingspan is 14â€“15 mm. The forewings are ochreous-white with a dark fuscous dot towards the costa near the base and two transversely placed in the disc at one-fifth. There are about eight short oblique brown strigulae on the costa. There are transverse undefined patches of ochreous-brown suffusion in the disc at one-third, beyond the middle and towards the termen, the first narrow, second broader, reaching the costa and the third largest, somewhat mixed with black scales and bounded by a grey terminal streak. Between these are two lilac-grey sometimes whitish-centred irregularly eight-shaped spots in the disc before the middle and at two-thirds, the first rather oblique and the second shorter. The hindwings are fuscous-whitish.
