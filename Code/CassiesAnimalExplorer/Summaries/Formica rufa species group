The Formica rufa group is a subgeneric group within the genus Formica, first proposed by William Morton Wheeler. This group contains the mound-building species of Formica commonly termed "wood ants" or "thatch-mound ants", which build prominent nests consisting of a mound of grass, litter, or conifer needles.  The species Formica rufa or the red wood ant is the type species of this subgroup.

This particular group can inhabit open woods with both hard and soft woods, dense pine forests, and even moor land. Workers are polymorphic, the largest reaching about 10 mm long. They can produce formic acid in their abdomens and eject it 12 cm in the air when threatened.  The only function of males is to mate in flight with queens. Species previously attributed to the Microgyna group were transferred to the  F. rufa group by the Wheelers in 1986.
