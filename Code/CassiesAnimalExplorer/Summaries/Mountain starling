The mountain starling (Aplonis santovestris), Vanuatu starling, Santo mountain starling or Santo starling, is a bird species in the family Sturnidae. It is endemic to the island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu. It is restricted to cloud forest on that island. The species was seldom seen in the 20th century and was at one point feared extinct, although a 1991 expedition managed to find a population high in the mountains.
