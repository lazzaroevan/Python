The forktails are small insectivorous birds in the genus Enicurus. They were formerly in the thrush family, Turdidae, but are more often now treated as part of the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. Their name derives from their long forked tail.These are southeast Asian forest species principally associated with mountain forests and streams. Most nest in rock crevices, laying 2â€“4 eggs.
