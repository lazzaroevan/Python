It is endemic to the Central African Republic and only known from its type locality, Bouala (originally spelled "Buala"), at 998 m (3,274 ft) above sea level on the Ouham River. The specific name elberti honours Johannes Elbert, a German naturalist who visited Kamerun in 1914. Common name Elbert's river frog has been coined for this species.
