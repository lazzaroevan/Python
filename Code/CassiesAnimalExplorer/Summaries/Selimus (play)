Selimus, or The Tragedy of Selimus, Sometime Emperor of the Turks, is a dramatic tragedy generally attributed to the authors Robert Greene and Thomas Lodge.  It is an early example of a "Turk play", which became a popular dramatic subject during the English Renaissance. Published in 1594, the play is loosely – and historically inaccurately – based on Selim I, a real Emperor of the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s.The play centres on Selimus, who is the youngest son of Bajazet, the current Emperor of Turkey, and how he plans to take the crown away from his father. The play follows the family turmoil that ensues as Selimus, Acomat, and Corcut, all sons of Bajazet, war and murder in an attempt to control the crown. Nearly all of Bajazet's line of descent is eradicated by the end of the play, and Selimus is left to rule as Emperor of Turkey.
