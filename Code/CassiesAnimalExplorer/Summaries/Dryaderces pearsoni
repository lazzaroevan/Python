Dryaderces pearsoni is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. Broadly defined, it is found in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. However, the nominal taxon includes two species, and true Dryaderces pearsoni is only known with certainty from Bolivia. The specific name pearsoni honors Nathan E. Pearson, an American ichthyologist who made a "splendid collection of amphibians" during an expedition to Bolivia, including the holotype of this species. Common name Pearson's slender-legged treefrog has been coined for the species.
