Pectinariidae, or the trumpet worms or ice cream cone worms, are a family of marine polychaete worms that build tubes using grains of sand roughly resembling ice cream cones or trumpets. These structures can be  up to 5 centimetres (2 in) long. The earliest pectinariid fossils are known from the Cretaceous.
