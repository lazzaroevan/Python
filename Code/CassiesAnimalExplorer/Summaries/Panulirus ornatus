Panulirus ornatus (known by a number of common names, including tropical rock lobster, ornate rock lobster, ornate spiny lobster and ornate tropical rock lobster) is a large edible spiny lobster with 11 larval stages that has been successfully bred in captivity.P. ornatus has a wide geographical range in the Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea and KwaZulu-Natal in the west to Japan and Fiji in the east. In most parts of its range, the lobster is netted or speared, while in Northeast Australia, a commercial fishery has existed since 1966 and the harvesting of the species is regulated by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The species now also occurs in the Mediterranean, having invaded as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal.The species is responsible for supporting a number of fisheries in Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, Torres Strait, and other Indo-Pacific regions. With such stress on a single species for commercial purposes, countries like Australia and Indonesia have started successful aquaculture practices.
