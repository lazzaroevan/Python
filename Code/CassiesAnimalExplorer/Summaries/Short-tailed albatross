The short-tailed albatross or Steller's albatross (Phoebastria albatrus) is a large rare seabird from the North Pacific.  Although related to the other North Pacific albatrosses, it also exhibits behavioural and morphological links to the albatrosses of the Southern Ocean.  It was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas from skins collected by Georg Wilhelm Steller (after whom its other common name is derived).  Once common, it was brought to the edge of extinction by the trade in feathers, but with protection has recently made a recovery.
