Sedenia erythrura is a moth in the family Crambidae. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from South Australia.The wingspan is about 28 mm. The forewings are whitish-ochreous, reddish-tinged with darker reddish markings. There is a thick suffused streak along the costa from the base to the apex, leaving the extreme costal edge ochreous-whitish. There is also a rather large discal dot beyond the middle which is indistinctly centred with white and there is a streak from five-sixths of the costa to the anal angle, as well as a small patch at the anal angle touching this streak. A moderate hindmarginal fascia runs from the apex to the anal angle, enclosing a well-defined streak of ground-colour between this and the preceding line. The hindwings are ochreous whitish, reddish-tinged with a suffused reddish hindmarginal line.
