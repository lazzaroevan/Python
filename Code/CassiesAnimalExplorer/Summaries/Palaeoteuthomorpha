Palaeoteuthomorpha is a superorder of primitive coleoid cephalopods, containing the Boletzkyida, characterized by an orthoceroid-like phragmocone early in ontogeny and a teuthid living chamber later in ontogeny. This contrasts with the later Teuthida  which have a reduced living chamber (gladius) throughout.
