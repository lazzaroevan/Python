Marocconus is an extinct genus from a well-known class of fossil marine arthropods, the trilobites. It is still debated if it lived at the very end of the Lower Cambrian or at the very beginning of the Middle Cambrian. Marocconus notabilis is the only known species in this genus (i.e. the genus is monotypic).
