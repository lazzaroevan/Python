Coxen's fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni), also known as the blue-browed, red-faced or southern fig parrot or lorilet, is one of the smallest and least known Australian parrots.  It is a highly endangered subspecies of the double-eyed fig parrot.  It was named by John Gould after his brother-in-law Charles Coxen.
