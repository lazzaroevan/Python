Thaumetopoea is a genus of moths belonging to the family Notodontidae. It was first described by Jacob HÃ¼bner in 1820.
In their caterpillar form, they bear the vernacular name of processionary because these gregarious larvae move in a single file. In their imago (adult moth) form, members of this genus live a few days without feeding.
Some Thaumetopoea species, for example Thaumetopoea pityocampa, are lepidopteran defoliators experiencing an expansion range towards higher latitudes and altitudes due to the current climate warming. Moreover, processionary caterpillars carry urticating setae, which cause health problems in humans.
