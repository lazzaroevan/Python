Parischnogaster jacobsoni is a species of social wasp within Parischnogaster, the largest and least known genus of Stenogastrinae. It is distinguished mainly by its tendency to construct ant guards on its nests. Natural selection has led this wasp to have a thick substance emitted from its abdominal glands that allows it to protect its nest from invasions. Parischnogaster as a genus has been relatively unstudied; P. jacobsoni is one of the few investigated species because it has sufficient durability to live near human populations and it has demonstrated unusual resilience to pollution. While P. jacobsoni is a more complex organism than other wasps in Parischnogaster, the genus overall is relatively primitive with respect to social wasps as a whole.
