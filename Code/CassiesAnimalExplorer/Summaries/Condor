Condor is the common name for two species of New World vultures, each in a monotypic genus. The name derives from the Quechua kuntur.  They are the largest flying land birds in the Western Hemisphere.
They are:

The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), which inhabits the Andean mountains.
The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), currently restricted to the western coastal mountains of the United States and Mexico and the northern desert mountains of Arizona in the United States.
