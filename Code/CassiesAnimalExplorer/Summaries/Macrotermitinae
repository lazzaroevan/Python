Macrotermitinae (fungus-growing termites), is  subfamily of Termitidae. Fungus-growing termites species cultivate a fungal genus within  Termitomyces  for decomposing dead plant material externally within the colony(Note: All termite species  decompose organic matter internally with the help of their gut microbiota rather than Macrotermitinae subfamily). Approximately 30 million years ago this subfamily starts to cultivate ancestor of Termitomyces. The real force or reasons to start the fungal domestication is not yet clear. Some gut microbiota based studies indicated that Macrotermitinae subfamily gut composition have close relationship with a cockroach species, both have similar gut microbial composition. This gut microbiota based evidence  strongly supported by amber sample which found an ancestor species of both termites and cockroach. An ant family also cultivates fungus in their colony, known as fungus-growing ants, these ants also show a similar symbiotic life style of fungus-growing termites. Researcher believes that Macrotermitinae is the last formed termite groups because of their complex colony life style. For example: over-lapping caste system and age-depended polyethism. Moreover, this subfamily gut composed with bacterial community, rather than flagellates. These fungus growers might be encoded with natural antibiotics because colony does not shows infections so far.
There are 14 genera which extended to 350 plus species so far in the subfamily.
