Burnetiamorpha is a clade of biarmosuchian therapsids. Burnetiamorphs are the most derived biarmosuchians. The name Burnetiamorpha has been in use since South African paleontologist Robert Broom erected the group in 1923, but it has recently been put to use in phylogenetic classification as a clade including Burnetiidae and its closest relatives, including Lemurosaurus, Lophorhinus, and Lobalopex.
