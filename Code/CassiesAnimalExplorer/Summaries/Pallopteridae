Pallopteridae is a family of flies. The various species are collectively called flutter-wing flies, trembling-wing, or waving-wing flies, because of the striking vibration of the wings in many species.  Over 70 species in about 15 genera are found in the temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
