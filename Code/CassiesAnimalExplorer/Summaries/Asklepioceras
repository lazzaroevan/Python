Asklepioceras is a genus in the Ceratitid family Arpaditidae from the Middle and Upper Triassic (Ladinian and Carnian stages) of Europe, Asia, and British Columbia.
Asklepioceras, named by Renz, 1910, is characterized by evolute to involute, discoidal to subglobular shells with a median (ventral) furrow not bordered by keels (in contrast to Dittmarites in which it is) and simple ceratitic sutures. (Arkell et al. 1962, L162) The genotype Asklepioceras segmentatus Renz, 1910,  based on Arpadites (Dittmarites) segmentatus Mojsisovics, 1893. is found in the Carnian of the Alps.
