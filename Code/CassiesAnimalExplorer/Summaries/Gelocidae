The Gelocidae are an extinct group of hornless ruminantia that are estimated to have lived during the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, from 36 MYA to 6 MYA. The family generally includes extinct hornless ruminants which do not belong to similar families such as Moschidae (musk deer) or Tragulidae. Fossils of family Gelocidae have been discovered in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America.
