Mycterosaurus (Greek as mykter/mykteros meaning nose/snout, sauros meaning “lizard”) is an extinct genus of synapsids belonging to the family Varanopidae. It is classified in the varanopid subfamily Mycterosaurinae. Mycterosaurus is the most primitive member of its family, existing from 290.1 to 272.5 MYA, known to Texas  and Oklahoma. It lacks some features that its advanced relatives have.
Mycterosaurus is a relatively small carnivore, estimated to be around 60 cm (23 inches) long with synonyms of Eumatthevia bolli, and possibly Basicranodon fortsillensis. Restored, Mycterosauruous appears spindly and grotesque in contrast to the majority of pelycosaurs in its proportions and especially unlike other edaphosaurs, which are commonly stocky in build.The number of valid Mycterosaurus species have varied over the years, with a total of two classifications of the Mycterosaurus longiceps and Mycterosaurus smithae.  However, recent analysis has led to a re-description of Mycterosaurus smithae.
