The Cretan owl (Athene cretensis) is an extinct species of owl from the Pleistocene of the island of Crete, in the eastern Mediterranean. It was first named by Weesie in 1982. In life, it would have been at least 60 cm tall, and flightless or nearly flightless. The Cretan owl became extinct after humans moved into Crete.
