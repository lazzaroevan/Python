The Condylopygidae Raymond (2013)  are a family of small trilobites that lived during the Middle Cambrian, and found in Canada (Newfoundland and Nova Scotia), the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Spain, England, Wales, Sweden, and the Russian Federation (Siberia). They uniquely differ from all other Agnostina in having the frontal glabellar lobe wider than the rear lobe. The Condylopygidae are the only family assigned to the Condylopygoidea superfamily.
