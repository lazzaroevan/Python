Buzdartherium (meaning "Buzdar beast") is a dubious genus of extinct indricothere hyracodont from Oligocene and possibly also Miocene aged sediments from the Chitarwata Formation of Pakistan. The monotypic species is B. gulkirao, named in 2016, and its remains have been found only in the Sulaiman Basin (Chitarwata Formation), which preserves rocks dating from as early as the Cretaceous, although the Indian Plate did not collide into the Eurasian Plate until about 30 million years ago, during the Early Oligocene.Buzdartherium shows Eurasian affinity and migrated from Eurasia to the Indian subcontinent or vice versa via the Western and Northern Indus Sutures, after drifting away from Gondwana during the Cretaceous and after the collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia, which occurred during the early Ypresian epoch of the Eocene period, around 55 million years ago.
