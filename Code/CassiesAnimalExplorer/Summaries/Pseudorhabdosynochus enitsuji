Pseudorhabdosynochus enitsuji is a diplectanid monogenean parasitic on the gills of groupers. It has been described in 2007 by Lassad Neifar & Louis Euzet. The name of the species honours French parasitologist Jean-Lou Justine (enitsuji is an anagram of Justine).
The species has been redescribed by Amira Chaabane, Lassad Neifar, and Jean-Lou Justine in 2017, from the type-material and additional specimens.
