Culicoides imicola  (Culicoides imicola Kieffer, former name C. pallidipennis Carter) is a species of Ceratopogonidae that transmits the bluetongue virus (BTV) and the African horse sickness virus. This particular species has been recorded in Africa, Asia and Europe. African midges feed on animal blood, including horse, cattle, and sheep. Unlike other species within the Culicoides genus, this species prefers drier habitats for egg laying but retains a preference for moist soil to support larvae growth. Other suspected BTV vectors are Culicoides (Culicoides) pulicaris and species in the Culicoides (Avaritia) obsoletus complex.
