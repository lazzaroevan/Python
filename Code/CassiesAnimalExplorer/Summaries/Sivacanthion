Sivacanthion is an extinct genus of rodent from the Miocene of Pakistan.
The build of Sivacanthion is very like that of a modern Old World porcupine, although details of the anatomy suggest that it is not a direct ancestor but a side branch of Hystricidae known in the Indian sub-continent.
Sivacanthion lived on the ground and ate plants and fruit.
