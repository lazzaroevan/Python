Attaphila is a genus of cockroaches that live as myrmecophiles in the nests of leaf-cutting ants. They have been suggested to feed on the fungus their host ants farm, or on the cuticular lipids of ant workers. Attaphila are not attacked by host workers because they blend into the colony by mimicking the odour of their hosts ants. Female Attaphila are wingless and males have reduced wings. Since they cannot fly themselves, the cockroaches disperse to new host colonies either by riding on virgin host queens that depart for the mating flight, or by following pheromone trails laid by ant workers.Six species of Attaphila have been described:
Attaphila fungicola Wheeler, 1900
Attaphila bergi Bol√≠var, 1901
Attaphila aptera Bolivar, 1905
Attaphila schuppi Bolivar, 1905
Attaphila sexdentis Bolivar, 1905
Attaphila flava Gurney, 1937
