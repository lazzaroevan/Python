Pseudoeurycea firscheini is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to the west-central Veracruz, Mexico, and known from Acultzingo (its type locality) on the Pueblaâ€“Veracruz border eastward to the Sierra Zongolica. It is also known as the Firschein's false brook salamander or simply Firschein's salamander. The specific name firscheini honors Mr. Irwin Lester Firschein, an American biologist, geneticists, and anthropologist. The authors acknowledge Firschein for his  explorations on Volcan San Martin, said to "have done much toward stimulating interest in this region of Mexico".
