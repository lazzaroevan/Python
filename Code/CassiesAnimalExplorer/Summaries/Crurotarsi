Crurotarsi is a group of archosauriform reptiles that includes the archosaurs (represented today by birds and crocodilians) and the extinct, crocodile-like phytosaurs. Prior to 2011, the name had instead been used to refer to archosaurs closer to crocodilians than to birds and other dinosaurs. Another common term for croc-line archosaurs is Pseudosuchia. The pre-2011 definition of Crurotarsi assumed that phytosaurs were closer to crocodilians than to birds. However, a 2011 study argued that phytosaurs were not crown-archosaurs (i.e. their lineage evolved prior to the split between bird-line and croc-line archosaurs). Crurotarsi was redefined to pertain to a larger group which included Phytosauria and Archosauria (true crown-archosaurs).The name Crurotarsi is derived from the Latin word crus (lower leg) and the Greek word tarsos (ankle). It refers to the specialized articulation (a crurotarsal joint) between the lower leg (specifically the fibula) and the ankle (specifically the calcaneum) which is present in the skeletons of reptiles such as suchians and phytosaurs. In their ankle joint, a hemicylindrical condyle on the calcaneum articulates into a concave area on the fibula.
