The pampas fox (Lycalopex gymnocercus), also known as grey pampean fox, pampas zorro, Azara's fox, or Azara's zorro (in Spanish also called aguará chaí, anglicized as aguarachay, in Portuguese also called graxaim), is a medium-sized zorro, or "false" fox, native to the South American pampas. Azara in some of its alternative common names is a reference to Spanish naturalist Félix de Azara.
