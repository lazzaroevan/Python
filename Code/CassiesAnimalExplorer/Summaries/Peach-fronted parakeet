The peach-fronted parakeet (Eupsittula aurea), more commonly known as the peach-fronted conure in aviculture, is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is widespread and often common in semi-open and open habitats in eastern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, far northern Argentina and southern Suriname (Sipaliwini savanna). Both its common and scientific name is a reference to the orange-yellow forehead, although this is reduced in juveniles.
