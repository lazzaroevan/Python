Cumia reticulata, common name the false triton, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Colubrariidae. Out of this family, there are at least 6 species that are known to feed on blood. This trait of feeding on blood is likely shared by the entire family. 
It is commonly known as the vampire snail because it feeds on the blood of fish when they are asleep. Colubraria reticulata are commonly found in rocky and coral environments that are tropical or subtropical and temperate seas. In addition, they are found in Benthic which is one of the ecological regions of a body of water. It comprises the bottom—such as the ocean floor or the bottom of a lake—the sediment surface, and some sub-surface layers.
