Lusitanisuchus is an extinct genus of mesoeucrocodylian crocodylomorph. Mostly fragmentary fossils have been found from several localities in Portugal and are Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous in age.
The type and only species, Lusitanisuchus mitracostatus, was named in 2004 after having previously been described as a species of the genus Lisboasaurus. L. mitracostatus was originally thought to have been an anguimorph lizard upon its naming in 1970 based on fragmentary jaw remains and isolated teeth found from the Kimmeridgean-age Guimarota Formation in Leiria  . The species was later regarded as a nomen dubium by several authors of papers regarding Lisboasaurus due to the incomplete nature of the known remains associated with the species. However, a later reexamination of fossils from the Guimarota Formation had found skull material that included a dentary similar to the one seen in the holotype of L. mitracostatus. These remains, being more complete than those of the holotype, showed that L. mitracostatus was really a crocodylomorph rather than an anguimorph. Furthermore, it was shown to be a genus distinct from Lisboasaurus, which had by then been shown to be a crocodylomorph as well.
Several teeth referable to Lusitanisuchus were also found from Porto Dinheiro, Lourinh√£ in strata deposited during the Berriasian stage of the Early Cretaceous, extending the temporal range of this taxon by about 15 Ma.
