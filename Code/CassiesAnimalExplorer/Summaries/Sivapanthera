Sivapanthera is a prehistoric genus of felid[[carnivora]n] described by Kretzoi in 1929. Species of  Sivapanthera are closely related to the modern cheetah (some authorities merge Sivapanthera into Acinonyx): species differ from modern cheetashs by having relatively longer brain cases, flatter foreheads, narrower nostrils and larger teeth. In many ways, skulls of Sivapanthera show similarity to that of the puma, or even those of Panthera.Two species were assigned to the genus in 2004:

Sivapanthera padhriensis from the Tertiary deposits in Pakistan's Sivalik Hills.
Sivapanthera linxiaensis from Early Pleistocene deposits in China's Dongxiang Autonomous County.
