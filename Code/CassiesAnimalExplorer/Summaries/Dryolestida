Dryolestida is an extinct order of mammals; most of the members are mostly known from the Jurassic to Paleogene, with one member, Necrolestes, surviving as late as the early Miocene. They are considered members of the clade Cladotheria, close to the ancestry of therian mammals.  It is also believed that they developed a fully mammalian jaw and also had the three middle ear bones.  Other than that, not much is known about them, this is because their fossils are made up mostly of jaw and tooth remains.
Dryolestids were formerly considered part of Pantotheria and/or Eupantotheria. The clade Quirogatheria, erected by Jos√© Bonaparte in 1992, is often used as a synonym for Dryolestida.  Originally, Quirogatheria was meant to include Brandoniidae, but this family is now included with the dryolestids.
