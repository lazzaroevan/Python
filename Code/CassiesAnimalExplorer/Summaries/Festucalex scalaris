The ladder pipefish (Festucalex scalaris) is a species of marine fish of the family Syngnathidae. It is endemic to Western Australia, occurring from Shark Bay to the Monte Bello Islands. It is a habitat generalist, with species samples being taken from trawls, from among weeds and algae and one sample from a pond. It is reported to occur on rocky-reefs in inlets, bays and lagoons, as well as shallow seagrass beds. It is expected to feed on small crustaceans, and can grow to lengths of 18 centimetres (7.1 in). This species is ovoviviparous, with males brooding eggs and giving birth to live young.
