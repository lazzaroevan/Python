Longeumolpus is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is mainly found in South America, though the type species (Longeumolpus imperialis) has also been reported from Martinique in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies. The genus was established in 1960 by the Czech entomologist Bohumila Špringlová de Bechyně (wife of Jan Bechyně) as a close relative of Eumolpus.One of the generic characters separating Longeumolpus from Eumolpus is the length of the penis in the males: in Eumolpus, the penis is short, and always less than half the length of the abdomen, while in Longeumolpus, the penis is very long and is at least three quarters of the abdomen's length.
