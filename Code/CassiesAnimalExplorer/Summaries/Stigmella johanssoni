Stigmella johanssoni is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is only known from the Tian Shan Mountains in southern Kazakhstan.
The length of the forewings is 2.3–2.6 millimetres (0.091–0.102 in). Adults were found in August, but are probably also on wing in early summer.
The larvae feed on Salix species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a broad gallery, occasionally forming a false blotch. The frass is black and deposited in a broad, irregular central line.
