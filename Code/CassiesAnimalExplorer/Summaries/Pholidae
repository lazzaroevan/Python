The gunnels are a family, Pholidae, of marine fishes in the order Perciformes. They are elongated, somewhat eel-like fishes that range from the intertidal zone to depths of 200 m (660 ft), though the majority are found in shallow waters. Most are restricted to the North Pacific, ranging as far south as Baja California and East China. The only exceptions are Pholis gunnellus from the North Atlantic, and P. fasciata from the Arctic Sea, North Atlantic and North Pacific. They typically reach a maximum length of 20–30 cm (8–12 in), but Apodichthys flavidus reaches 46 cm (18 in). They eat small crustaceans and molluscs.
