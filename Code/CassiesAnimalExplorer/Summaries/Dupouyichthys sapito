Dupouyichthys sapito is the only species of banjo catfishes in the genus Dupouyichthys. This species appears to be restricted to the Magdalena and Maracaibo basins. D. sapito is a small, armored aspredinid, growing up to 27 millimetres (1.1 in) SL, distinguished from all other aspredinids by having only one set of paired pre-anal-fin plates. Also, the bony ornamentation of its skull is better developed than its close relatives. It is found in river banks with vegetation.
