Seriola carpenteri is a species of bony fish commonly known as the Guinean amberjack (French: Sériole guinéenne, Spanish: Medregal de Guinea) which feeds on squids and fishes.  It attains a size of at least 48 centimeters (18.9 inches) fork length, and probably attains a much larger size. Adults are pelagic or epibenthic.  Generally confined to areas where surface temperatures exceed 25 °C, the species is found in coastal waters over continental shelf from the surface to at least 200 meters (656.2 feet).  Its distribution is along the African coasts from Angola northward to Cape Verde, Dakar, with single records from near Agadir, Morocco and the Bay of Biscay, perhaps influenced by seasonal movements of the 18-27 °C water mass along the African coast. It has also been recorded twice in schools off Lampedusa in the central Mediterranean, but these were in breeding condition suggesting that the species has become established there. Its presence may be disguised by its resemblance to Seriola dumerili.The species is named for "William K. Carpenter of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Mr. Carpenter, an outstanding big game fisherman, has long been President and leading sponsor of the International Game Fish Association.  His dedicated support of marine science includes generous financial contributions and outstanding personal participation in research activities."
