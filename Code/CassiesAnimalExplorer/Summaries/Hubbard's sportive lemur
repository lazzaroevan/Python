Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park is the only protected area it is documented in. "This species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation from shifting agriculture, as well as unsustainable levels of hunting."Originally named L. hubbardi, the name was found to be incorrectly formed and was corrected to L. hubbardorum in 2009.Sportive lemurs of the family Lepilemuridae, are medium sized nocturnal lemurs that are folivorous, meaning they eat leaves.
