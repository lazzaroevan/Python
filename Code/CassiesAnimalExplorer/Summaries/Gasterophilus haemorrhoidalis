Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis (also called nose botfly or lip botfly) is a species of the genus Gasterophilus that lays eggs on the lips and around the mouth of horses, mules and donkeys.
In Equidae, third-stage larvae attach to the stomach, but also to the rectum, sometimes in great numbers. Heavy infestation can cause anal prolapse in foals and mules.
They do not parasitise humans.
