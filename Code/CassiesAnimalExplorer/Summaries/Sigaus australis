Sigaus australis is the most common alpine grasshopper found in New Zealand. It can be found in the southern half of the South Island above the tree line. Sigaus australis was described in 1897 by Frederick Hutton. Like all of New Zealand sub-alpine and alpine grasshoppers S. australis has a 2 or 3 years life cycle. Individuals can survive the cold by freezing solid at any life stage, at any time of the year. Sigaus australis adults are relatively large grasshoppers (females ~ 26mm). The genus Sigaus is endemic to New Zealand.
