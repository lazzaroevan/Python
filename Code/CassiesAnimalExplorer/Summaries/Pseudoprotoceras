Pseudoprotoceras is an extinct genus of Artiodactyla, of the family Protoceratidae, endemic to central North America. It lived during the Late Eocene 37.2â€”33.9 Ma, existing for approximately 3 million years. Pseudoprotoceras resembled hornless deer, but were more closely related to camelids.
Body mass was similar to other Eocene protoceratids such as Heteromeryx and Poabromylus yet greater than Leptotragulus and Leptoreodon. Miocene members were apparently larger as well.
