Shuotheriidae is a small Mesozoic family of mammals whose remains are found in China, England and Russia. It is part of the clade Yinotheria, of which today only the monotremes are extant members. However, some studies suggest shuotheres are closer to therians than to monotremes. The Shuotheriidae are probably a sister group of the Gondwanian clade Henosferida and the Monotremata, which are the monotremes.
