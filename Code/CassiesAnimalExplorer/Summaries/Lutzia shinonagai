Lutzia shinonagai was first described in 1979.  The genus name was originally spelled LÃ¼tzia; the species name honors medical entomologist Dr. Satoshi Shinonaga who has published extensively on the taxonomy of the muscid, sarcophagid and calliphorid flies of Japan and the Oriental Region. Lutzia shinonagai is the only species in the subgenus Insulalutzia.
