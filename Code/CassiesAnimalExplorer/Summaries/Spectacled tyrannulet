The spectacled tyrannulet, specious tyrannulet or mountain tyrannulet (Zimmerius improbus) is a small passerine bird in the tyrant flycatcher family. It occurs in Venezuela and Colombia.
The spectacled tyrannulet was described in 1871 by the English naturalists Philip Sclater and Osbert Salvin under the binomial name Tyranniscus improbus. It was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Guatemalan tyrannulet (Zimmerius vilissimus).There are two subspecies:
Z. i. tamae (Phelps & Phelps Jr, 1954) – Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northeast Colombia
Z. i. improbus (Sclater, PL & Salvin, 1871) – Serranía del Perijá in northeast Colombia and northwest Venezuela
