Stenoterommata tenuistyla is a species of mygalomorph spiders of Argentina, named after the thin, slender embolus in males of this species, which distinguish it from males of the sympatric S. crassistyla. Females are distinguished from other three-clawed Stenoterommata by their spermathecae, which have a short basal portion and a single receptaculum arising from near the tip of the base. Males are diagnosed by one of the species autapomorphies: the presence of numerous short spines on the ventral metatarsus I.
