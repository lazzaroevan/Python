Crassispira pseudoprincipalis is an extinct species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pseudomelatomidae, the turrids and allies.There seems to be confusion about the accepted name of this species. According to the University of Tokyo, the accepted name is Crassispira pseudoprincipalis, while according to the World Register of Marine Species, the accepted name is Inquisitor pseudoprincipalis. Both rely on the basionym Pleurotoma (Drillia) pseudoprincipalis Yokoyama, 1920.
