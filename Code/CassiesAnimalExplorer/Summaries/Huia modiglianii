Huia modiglianii is a species of frog in the family Ranidae. It is endemic to Sumatra (Indonesia). It was originally only known from two locations near Lake Toba, but is now known to be more widespread. The specific name modiglianii honors Elio Modigliani, an Italian anthropologist and zoologist who collected the holotype in 1891. Common name Modigliani's huia frog has been coined for this species. Morphological evidence suggests that it can hybridize with Huia sumatrana, but this needs confirmation using genetic data.
