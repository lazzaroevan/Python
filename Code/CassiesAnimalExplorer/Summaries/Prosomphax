Prosomphax is a very small genus in the geometer moth family (Geometridae). As of 2005, only four species had been described; all are found in the southern half of Africa. This little-studied genus belongs to the emerald moth subfamily (Geometrinae), but beyond that its relationships are still rather obscure.The species of Prosomphax are:
Prosomphax callista Warren, 1911
Prosomphax deuterurga Prout, 1922
Prosomphax anomala (Warren, 1902)
Prosomphax horitropha Kr√ºger, 2005
