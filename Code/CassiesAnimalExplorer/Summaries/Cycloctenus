Cycloctenus is a genus of Australasian araneomorph spiders in the family Cycloctenidae, first described by L. Koch in 1878. Originally placed with the nursery web spiders, it was transferred to the family Toxopidae because of the distinctive arrangement of its eyes, particularly the enlarged posterolateral eyes. It was moved to the Cycloctenidae in 1967.
