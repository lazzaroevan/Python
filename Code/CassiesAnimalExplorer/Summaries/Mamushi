There are four subspecies including the nominate subspecies described here.This species and the Okinawan habu (Protobothrops flavoviridis) are the most venomous snakes in Japan.  Every year, 2000â€“3000 people in Japan are bitten by a mamushi. Bitten victims typically require one week of treatment in a hospital. Severe bites require intensive care, and approximately 10 victims die annually.
