Pseudococcus viburni (formerly Pseudococcus affinis (Maskell), and commonly known as the obscure mealybug and tuber mealybug) is a close relative of the grape mealybug (P. maritimus) and a pest of the vineyards of New Zealand, the Central Coast of California, and the tea gardens of northern Iran. Unlike the grape mealybug, the obscure mealybug is not native to California, having most likely been introduced to the region from either Australia or South America in the latter part of the 19th century.
