The long-tailed rosefinch (Carpodacus sibiricus) is a species of finch of the family Fringillidae.
It is found in China, Japan, Kazakhstan, North Korea, South Korea, and Russia. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, and temperate grassland.
It is a very rare vagrant to Europe, but like several related Asiatic rosefinches, is reasonably frequent in the cage bird trade, so many records have been considered to relate to escapes.
