Pseudorhabdosynochus hargisi is species of a diplectanid monogenean parasitic on the gills of the White grouper Epinephelus aeneus. It was described in 1984 as Diplectanum hargisi and transferred to the genus Pseudorhabdosynochus by Santos, Buchmann & Gibson in 2000.  Its systematic position has been clarified by Kritsky, Bakenhaster & Adams in 2015, who differentiated it from Pseudorhabdosynochus americanus.
