The Perinet chameleon (Calumma gastrotaenia), also known as the Malagasy side-striped chameleon, is a small species of chameleon endemic to humid primary forests, particularly along rivers, in eastern and central Madagascar at elevations between 600 and 1,530 m. It is listed on CITES Appendix II, and as such, trade in the Perinet chameleon is regulated. Exporting the species from Madagascar has been banned since 1995.
