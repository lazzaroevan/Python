Permothrips is an extinct genus of thrip from the Archescytinidae family that is notable for being the oldest record of thrips to date. The type species (P. longipennis) was described on the basis of PIN 2506/4, a single exoskeleton found in Sedy, Russia. It was probably a fungus feeding ancestor of the Mesozoic thrips.
