Smerinthus saliceti, the Salicet sphinx, is a moth of the family Sphingidae. The species was first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1875. It is found in valleys and along streamsides from Mexico City north to western Texas, southern Arizona and extreme southern California.The wingspan is 67â€“89 mm. The forewing outer margin is wavy and the upperside of the forewing is gray brown with distinct dark and light bands. The upperside of the hindwing is mostly red with a yellow tanned outer margin and a blue spot which is usually divided by a V-shaped black line.
Adults are on wing from April to September, probably in two generations.
The larvae feed on Salix and Populus species. There are two color morphs, pale green and lime green.
