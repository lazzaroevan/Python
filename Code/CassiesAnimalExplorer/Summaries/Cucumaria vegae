Cucumaria vegae, also known as tiny black sea cucumber or northern tar spot, is a species of sea cucumber.  It was first described to science by Johan Hjalmar Th√©el in 1886 reporting on the sea cucumber specimens brought back by the Challenger expedition.  Among these was the type specimen for this species, which was collected at Bering Island.
