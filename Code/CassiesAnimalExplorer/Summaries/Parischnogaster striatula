Parischnogaster striatula is a species of social hover wasps found in Southeast Asia. Their nests are uniquely shaped, mimic their surroundings and, like the other Stenogastrinae social wasps, lack a nest pedicel. They are also unique in their use of glandular secretion when laying eggs. P. striatula is also different than typical wasps because the queens are not the only ones who possess reproductive capabilities; other females also have developed ovaries. This wasp is also known for fiercely protecting its nest against enemies, such as ants or other hornets.
