The Papuan eagle (Harpyopsis novaeguineae) is a large bird of prey. It is also known known by several other names including the Papuan harpy eagle, New Guinea eagle, New Guinea harpy eagle or Kapul eagle, the latter name from the local name for a, usually arboreal, marsupial that the eagle is known to regularly hunt. This is an endemic species to New Guinea and it can occasionally be found throughout the island. This is a forest dwelling species, usually occurring in mature rainforest. The Papuan eagle is a fairly little-known species for a large eagle, however it is known to prey on a wide range of prey, probably by and large mammals and birds from small to quite large sizes. What little study has been conducted about their breeding habits suggest they nest in a large forest tree, perhaps every other year. The Papuan eagle is probably naturally scarce but it is under the threat of deforestation as well as to hunting. Due to its small and declining population, the species has been classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN.
