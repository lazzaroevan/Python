The forewings are ochreous white with the plical and first discal stigmata minute and dark fuscous, the plical very obliquely posterior, the second discal forming a dark fuscous transverse mark followed by a spot of fuscous suffusion. There is some slight fuscous irroration above the middle of the dorsum and a spot of dark fuscous suffusion above the dorsum near the tornus. A rather curved line formed of fuscous lunulate marks is found from the costa at four-fifths, to the tornus, indented towards the costa. There is also a terminal series of small black dots. The hindwings are white.
