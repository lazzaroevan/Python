Conorhynchos conirostris is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes).
The spelling of the generic name has been confused; it is currently valid as Conorhynchos as described by Pieter Bleeker in 1858. This catfish has unknown relationships. It does not appear to be assignable to any family and is placed incertae sedis. However, it has been grouped into the superfamily Pimelodoidea due to molecular evidence.Conorhynchos conirostris is endemic to the SÃ£o Francisco River in Brazil and is considered a symbol of the river. This fish can reach 53.5 centimetres (21.1 in) in standard length and 13 kilograms (29 lb) in weight. This fish is of commercial interest, and is considered threatened by Brazil's Ministry of the Environment.
