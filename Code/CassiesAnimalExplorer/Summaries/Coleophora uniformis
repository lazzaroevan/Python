Coleophora uniformis is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in Japan.
The wingspan is 9â€“10 mm.
The larvae feed on Sorbus alnifolia. They create a pale reddish-brown, tubular case of about 4 mm in length, with a blackish dorsal patch, which is definitely restricted from other parts of the case and occupies the area from the mouth to before the anal flap. The larva mines the leaf of the host plant until late June and fixes the case on the twig before pupation.
