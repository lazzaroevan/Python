The Pelew flying fox (Pteropus pelewensis) is a species of megabat in the genus Pteropus found in the Pelew Islands. A subspecies found on Yap, the Yap flying fox, is considered as a separate species by some authorities.  The species is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN due to commercial and small-scale hunting; commercial hunting for the species was banned in 1994, but local exploitation is commonplace.  The species is listed on CITES appendix I.
