Phyllonorycter auronitens is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Qu√©bec in Canada and Massachusetts, Kentucky, Maine, North Carolina, Vermont and Connecticut in the United States.The wingspan is 6.5-8.2 mm.
The larvae feed on Alnus species, including Alnus incana, Alnus rubra and Alnus rugosa. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a tentiform mine on the underside of the leaf. The mine is roundish and the loosened epidermis is much wrinkled, resulting in the leaf being rather arched at this place.
