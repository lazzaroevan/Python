Sternotomis chrysopras is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It has a wide distribution in Africa. It feeds on Artocarpus altilis, Theobroma cacao, Coffea liberica, and Coffea canephora. While originally named by Voet in 1778, the name was not validly published until 1844; Voet's 1778 work fails to fulfill the requirement in ICZN Article 11.4 that a work must be consistently binominal; none of Voet's 1778 names, including S. chrysopras, are available.
