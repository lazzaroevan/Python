Phrynomedusa vanzolinii, or Vanzolini's leaf frog, is a frog in the family Phyllomedusidae. It is endemic to southeastern Brazil where it is currently known from Teresópolis in the state of Rio de Janeiro and Boraceia in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It probably occurs more widely than current records suggest, especially in areas between the two known sites. It is possible that this species is a synonym of Phrynomedusa appendiculata.
