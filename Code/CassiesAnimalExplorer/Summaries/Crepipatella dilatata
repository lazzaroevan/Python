Crepipatella dilatata is a species of sea snail described by Lamarck.  It is a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Calyptraeidae, the slipper snails or slipper limpets, cup-and-saucer snails, and hat snails.This species can be distinguished from the other species of South American Crepipatella by examination of developing embryos.  The females brood capsules that include both un-cleaving nurse eggs and viable embryos. The embryos consume the nurse eggs and develop into juveniles that crawl away from the capsule at hatching.
