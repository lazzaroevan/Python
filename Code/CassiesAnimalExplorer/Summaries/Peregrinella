Peregrinella is an extinct Early Cretaceous Rhynchonellide genus with scattered, global representation from North America to Europe and Tibet. These brachiopods are stationary epifaunal suspension feeders, its most distinguishing feature is the size, considered to be the largest of all Mesozoic Rhynchonellides, which has long puzzled paleontologists because of its unusual morphology, stratigraphic occurrence, and distribution patterns.
