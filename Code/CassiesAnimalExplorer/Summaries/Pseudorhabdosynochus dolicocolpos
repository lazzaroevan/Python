Pseudorhabdosynochus dolicocolpos is a diplectanid monogenean parasitic on the gills of groupers. It has been described in 2007 by Lassad Neifar & Louis Euzet. The species name refers to the size of the vagina and is derived from the Greek words “dolicos” meaning long and “colpos” vagina.
The species has been redescribed by Amira Chaabane, Lassad Neifar, and Jean-Lou Justine in 2017.
