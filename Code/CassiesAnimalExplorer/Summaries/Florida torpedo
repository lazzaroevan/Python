The Florida torpedo (Torpedo andersoni) is a rare and little-known species of electric ray in the family Torpedinidae. It is known only from two specimens and a some wild sightings. Torpedoes have been recorded from three scattered locations in the Florida Straits and the western Caribbean Sea, and appear to inhabit coral habitats.
A small species growing up to 32 cm (13 in) long, the Florida torpedo has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc with a short, thick tail. It can be identified by its distinctive dorsal coloration of many brown blotches on a tan background, and the relatively forward position of its first dorsal fin.
