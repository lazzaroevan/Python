The mangar (Luciobarbus esocinus) is a large species of ray-finned fish in the genus Luciobarbus, native to the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey.The species is highly prized as a food fish, but it has declined due to overfishing and habitat loss, making it vulnerable. It was well-known even in ancient times and there are illustrations from 1500–1000 BC showing Assyrian priests or deities dressed in the skin of magar.
