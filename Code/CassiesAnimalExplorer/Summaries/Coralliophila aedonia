Coralliophila aedonia is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Muricidae, the murex snails or rock snails.The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) states that the subgenus Murex (Pseudomurex) has been brought into synonymy with Pseudomurex Monterosato, 1872, leaving the status of  Murex (Pseudomurex) aedonius unchanged. The genus Pseudomurex  in turn has been brought into synonymy with Coralliophila H. Adams & A. Adams, 1853 by M. Oliverio in 2008. This genus contains the species Coralliophila (Pseudomurex) aedonia. Therefore, there is good reason to believe that both species are synonyms.
