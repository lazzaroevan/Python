The fusiliers are a family, Caesionidae, of fishes in the order Perciformes. The family includes about 23 species. They are related to the snappers, but adapted for feeding on plankton, rather than on larger prey. They are found at reefs in the Indo-Pacific.
They are cylindrical, streamlined fishes, of up to 60 cm (24 in), though most species only reach about half that length. Their upper jaws are extensible, and adapted for picking plankton.
