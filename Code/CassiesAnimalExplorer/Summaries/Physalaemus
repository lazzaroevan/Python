Physalaemus is a large genus of leptodactylid frogs. These frogs, sometimes known as dwarf frogs or foam frogs, are found in South America. It is very similar to Leptodactylus, a close relative, and indeed the recently rescribed Leptodactylus lauramiriamae is in some aspects intermediate between them.
