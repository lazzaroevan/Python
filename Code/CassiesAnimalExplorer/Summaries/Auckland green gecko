The Auckland green gecko (Naultinus elegans) is a species of gecko found only in the northern half of the North Island of New Zealand, except north of Whangaroa.  The Wellington green gecko, formerly considered a subspecies (together called common green gecko), is found in the southern half of the North Island and the two ranges do not overlap.  Its length is up to 145 mm, snout to vent.Apart from range, the Auckland green gecko differs from the Wellington green gecko in that it is marginally smaller and more slender in build and also the undersurfaces of the feet and toes in elegans are coloured grey green, while they are yellow in colouration in the latter species.
