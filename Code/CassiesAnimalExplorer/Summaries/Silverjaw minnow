Silverjaw minnows (Ericymba buccata) are part of the family Cyprinidae, which includes carps and minnows.  With over 300 known species, there are more species of minnows native to North America's fresh waters than any other fish.  Minnows can be hard to distinguish because many look alike.  All minnows have one dorsal fin, ventral fins near the anus, a lateral line system (in most species), and smooth, round cycloid scales.  Their jaws lack teeth, but they have one to three rows of pharyngeal teeth to grind food.  Defining physical characteristics such as the number and type of fin rays, type of scales, and pattern of pharyngeal teeth are used to distinguish minnows.Silverjaw minnows have a head with a flat underside and large silvery-white chambers on the sides that form their complete lateral line system. Since these fish are relatively small, 2-3 inches in length, large numbers can exist in a small area and still find necessary resources.  They are native to many streams and rivers in the United States in a disjunct distribution.
