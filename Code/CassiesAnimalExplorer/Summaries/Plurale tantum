A plurale tantum (Latin for "plural only", plural form: pluralia tantum) is a noun that appears only in the plural form and does not have a singular variant for referring to a single object. In a less strict usage of the term, it can also refer to nouns whose singular form is rarely used.
In English, pluralia tantum are often words which denote objects that occur or function as pairs or sets, such as spectacles, trousers, pants, scissors, clothes, or genitals. Other examples are for collections which, like alms and feces, cannot conceivably be singular. Other examples include suds, jeans, outskirts, odds, riches, surroundings, thanks, and heroics.
In some languages, pluralia tantum refer to points or periods of time (for example, Latin kalendae 'calends, the first day of the month', German Ferien 'vacation, holiday') or to events (for example, Finnish häät 'wedding' and kasvot 'face'). In some cases there is no obvious semantic reason for a particular noun to be plurale tantum. The Hebrew מַיִם (mayim) 'water', Chichewa madzí 'water', Dutch hersenen 'brain', Swedish pengar and Russian den'gi (деньги) 'money' are pluralia tantum.
A bilingual example is the Latin word fasces, which was brought into English; when referring to the symbol of authority, it is a plurale tantum noun in both languages.
