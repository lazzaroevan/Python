Panaque armbrusteri  is a recently described species from the South American armoured catfish family Loricariidae. They are distributed throughout the Tapajós river, a large tributary of the Amazon River, with similar populations found in the Xingu, Araguaia, Tocantins  and Aripuanã rivers; although it is uncertain whether these populations comprise the same or different species. It is a fairly popular aquarium fish amongst other pleco species, and is one of the species commonly referred to as a royal pleco.
