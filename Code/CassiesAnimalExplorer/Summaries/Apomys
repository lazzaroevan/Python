Apomys, commonly known as earthworm mice, is a genus of rodent endemic to the Philippines.  Mice belonging to this genus are generally called Philippine forest mice and can be found on most islands of the Philippines except in Palawan, the Sulu Archipelago, and the Batanes and Babuyan group of islands.
Apomys mice weigh from 18g to 128g. The tail is longer or nearly equal the length of the head and body.  The soft and thick fur of these mice is darker on the back while the front fur is paler, often nearly white with a moderate orange yellow wash. The hind feet are moderately long and narrow, have six plantar pads, and have digits 2â€“4 notably longer than digit 5 and the hallux. All species have two pairs of inguinal mammae.
