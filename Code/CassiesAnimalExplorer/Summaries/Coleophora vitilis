Coleophora vitilis is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in Turkestan and Uzbekistan.
The wingspan is 13–15 mm.
The larvae feed on Artemisia juncea. They create a leafy case, consisting of large pieces of leaves arranged alternately on one or the other side giving the impression of a woven case. The pieces used to increase the size of the case are cut from the middle part of the leaf blade. The valve is two-sided. The case has a length of 6.5–8 mm and is chocolate-brown or grayish in color. Larvase can be found in the beginning of June and (after diapause) from the end of April to the beginning of May.
