Aubria masako is a species of frog in the family Pyxicephalidae. It is found in southeastern Cameroon, eastern Gabon, southwestern Central African Republic, northern Republic of the Congo, and eastward to the central Democratic Republic of the Congo, with one (doubtful) record from Angola; it might occur in Equatorial Guinea. Common names Masako ball frog and Masako fishing frog have been coined for this species. Its distinctness from Aubria subsigillata has been debated, but at present it is treated as a valid species.
