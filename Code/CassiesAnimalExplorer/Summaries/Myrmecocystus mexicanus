Myrmecocystus mexicanus is a species of ant in the genus Myrmecocystus, which is one of the six genera that bear the common name "honey ant" or "honeypot ant", due to curious behavior where some of the workers will swell with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of nest chambers, acting as living food storage for the colony.   Honey ants are found in North America, Australia, and Africa. Ant species belonging to the genus Myrmecocystus reside in North America.  M. mexicanus in particular is found in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.
