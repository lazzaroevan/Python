Culiseta melanura, the black-tailed mosquito, is a species of mosquito in the family Culicidae. Since adult female Culiseta melanura primarily take their blood meals from birds, they are responsible for transmitting eastern equine encephalitis virus between birds. Humans, horses, and other mammals become infected with eastern equine encephalitis virus when other mosquito species besides Culiseta melanura, such as Aedes, Coquillettidia, and Culex species take blood meals first from infected birds and then later take blood meals from mammals, transferring the virus to these hosts.
