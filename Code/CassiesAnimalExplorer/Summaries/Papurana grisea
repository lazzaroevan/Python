Papurana grisea is a species of true frog. It is known with certainty only from its type locality in the Went Mountains, in the Indonesian province of Papua, New Guinea. Similar frogs are widespread in New Guinea, usually above 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above sea level, as well as on the Seram Island, but their identity is uncertain; they possibly represent another, undescribed species. Common names Went Mountains frog and Montaen swamp frog have been coined for it.
