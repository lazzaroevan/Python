Colubroidea is a superfamily of snakes in the clade Colubroides that include Colubridae and a few other related families. Historically, Colubroidea also included other caenophidian snakes such as cobras and vipers, as these snakes form a clade. However these groups are now divided into several distinct, but related, families. Zaher et al. (2009) proposed to redefine Colubroidea for colubrids and related families, while designating Colubroides as the group containing vipers and cobras as well as colubroids.Below are the families and subfamilies that are found in Colubroidea sensu stricto:
