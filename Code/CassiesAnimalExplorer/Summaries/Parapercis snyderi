Parapercis snyderi, commonly known as Snyder's grubfish or U-mark sandperch, is a marine fish native to the waters off northern Australia and Indonesia. The specific name honours the ichthyologist John Otterbein Snyder who collected the type specimen with David Starr Jordan, one of the co-describers of the species, at Nagasaki.
