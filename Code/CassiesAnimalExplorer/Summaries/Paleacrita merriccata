It is found in eastern North America, where it has been recorded from central Illinois, eastern Missouri, west-central Mississippi, Louisiana and eastern Texas.The length of the forewings is 14â€“18 mm for males. The females are wingless. Adults are similar to Paleacrita vernata, but less variable in maculation. There is a white discal dot white, narrowly outlined in dark grayish brown and there is a dark costal dash. The cubital vein is variably dark scaled. The hindwings are similar to those of P. vernata.
