Sesommata trachyptera is a moth of the family Palaephatidae. It was described by Davis in 1986. It is found in the temperate Valdivian forest region of southern Argentina and Chile.
The length of the forewings is 5.7–6.3 mm for males and 6–7 mm for females. Adult males have dark fuscous forewings with an elongate patch of rough, semi-erect, slender sex scales. The forewings of the females are paler, more brown, and irrorated with scattered white scales. Adults are on wing from November to March, probably in one generation per year.
