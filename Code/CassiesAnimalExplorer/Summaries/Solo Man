Solo Man (Homo erectus soloensis) is a subspecies of H. erectus which lived along the Solo River in Java, Indonesia, about 117 to 108 thousand years ago in the Late Pleistocene. It is known from 14 skulls, two tibiae, and a piece of the pelvis excavated near the village Ngandong, possibly in addition to three skulls from Sambungmacan and a skull from Ngawi. The Ngandong site was first excavated from 1931 to 1933 under the direction of Willem Frederik Florus Oppenoorth, Carel ter Haar, and Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald, but further study was set back by the Great Depression, World War II, and the Indonesian War of Independence.
The Solo Men skulls are oval-shaped in top view, with heavy brows, inflated cheek bones, and a prominent occipital bun. Brain volume was quite large ranging from 1,013 to 1,251 cc (compared to 1,270 cc for present-day males and 1,130 for present-day females). One female may have been 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) in height and 51 kg (112 lb) in weight, and males were probably much bigger than females. 
The Solo Men likely inhabited an open woodland environment along with elephants, tigers, gaur, tapirs, hippos, and more. For stone tools, they produced simple flakes and cores. They probably descended from H. e. erectus which had earlier inhabited Java. In accordance with historical race concepts, Indonesian H. erectus were originally classified as the direct ancestors of Aboriginal Australians. The Solo Men are now generally thought to have no living descendants because they far predate modern human immigration into the area roughly 55,000 years ago. The Ngandong specimens likely died during a volcanic eruption, and the species as a whole probably went extinct on Java with the takeover of tropical rainforest, beginning by 125,000 years ago. The skulls sustained wounds, but it is unclear if these injuries are the result of an assault, cannibalism, the volcanic eruption, or the fossilisation process.
