The masked corydoras, bandit catfish, bandit corydoras, or Meta River corydoras, Corydoras metae, is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae.  It originates in inland waters of South America, and is found in the Meta River basin in Colombia.
The masked corydoras can grow up to 1.8 in (4.8 cm) in length.  It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 - 25 dGH, and a temperature range of 72 - 79°F (22 - 26°C).  It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. The female holds 2-4 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds. After fertilization the female swims to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The masked corydoras lays eggs in dense vegetation without adult protection. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached.
The masked corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.
