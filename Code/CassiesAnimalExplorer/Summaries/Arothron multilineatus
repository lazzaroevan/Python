Arothron multilineatus, the multilined pufferfish, is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Tetraodontidae. It is an uncommon fish and is known only from four specimens from Pagbilao in the Philippines, although photographs of individuals in the Ryukyu Islands, Mozambique and the Red Sea show that it has a wide distribution. It was first described by the Japanese ichthyologist Keiichi Matsuura in 2016.
