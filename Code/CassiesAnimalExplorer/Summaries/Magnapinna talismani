Magnapinna talismani is a species of bigfin squid known only from a single damaged specimen. It is characterised by small white nodules present on the ventral surface of its fins.
The holotype of M. talismani is a specimen of 61 mm mantle length (ML) collected in the northern Atlantic Ocean, south of the Azores, at 34°46′N 36°11′W. It was caught by an open bottom trawl at a depth of up to 3175 m. The capture location of this specimen is very near to that of the as-yet undescribed Magnapinna sp. B.
M. talismani was originally placed in the genus Chiroteuthopsis, which is now considered a junior synonym of Mastigoteuthis. Mastigoteuthis talismani was subsequently placed in the genus Magnapinna by Michael Vecchione and Richard E. Young in 2006.
