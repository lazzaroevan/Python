Stenaelurillus is a genus of jumping spiders that was first described by Eug√®ne Louis Simon in 1886. Most species live in Africa, with some species found in Asia, including China. All species have two white longitudinal stripes on the carapace, and both sexes show strong bristles around the eyes. The name is a combination of the Greek sten- "narrow" and the salticid genus Aelurillus.
