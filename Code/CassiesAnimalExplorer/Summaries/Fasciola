Fasciola, commonly known as the liver fluke, is a genus of parasitic trematodes. There are two species within the genus Fasciola: Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, as well as hybrids between the two species. Both species infect the liver tissue of a wide variety of mammals, including humans, in a condition known as fascioliasis. F. hepatica measures up to 30 mm by 15 mm, while F. gigantica measures up to 75 mm by 15 mm.
