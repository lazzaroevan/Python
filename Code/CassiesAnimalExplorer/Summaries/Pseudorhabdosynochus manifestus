Pseudorhabdosynochus manifestus is a diplectanid monogenean parasite first found in host Epinephelus malabaricus near Noum√©a, between its secondary gill lamellae. It can infest its host by the hundreds. It was ascribed that name because it was the most abundant species found while its descriptive study was taking place. As appreciated from studying juvenile specimens, the development of female organs precedes that of male organs in this species and is likely the case in other Pseudorhabdosynochus species.Pseudorhabdosynochus huitoe, Pseudorhabdosynochus shenzhenensis and Pseudorhabdosynochus serrani all share with P. manifestus: a sclerotised vagina with a conical primary canal with one lonely coil anteriorly, and small primary and secondary chambers. P. huitoe, furthermore, shares P. manifestus' characteristic spherical primary chamber with a think internal wall. P. manifestus is different by having a longer vagina, and morphological differences in the quadriloculate organ and hamuli.P. shenzhenensis and P. serrani also differ from P. manifestus by measurements of hamuli and quadriloculate organs, which are greater in the latter. At the same time, the former do not show a distinctive ring in the posterior part of the primary canal, while the shape of their chambers is different as well. Finally, tegumental scales could also show morphological differences amongst these species.
