The decorated warbonnet (Chirolophis decoratus) is a fish of the family Stichaeidae. The species name, decoratus, is a Latin word meaning ornamented.  The decorated warbonnet was given its name because of the prominent cirri on its head which resembles the feathers in an Indian Chieftain's war bonnet.
