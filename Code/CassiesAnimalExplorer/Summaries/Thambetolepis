Thambetolepis is a dubious genus of sachitid halkieriid from the Cambrian (530-513 Ma). The genus Sinosachites may have been the same as Thambetolepis.
The sclerites of Sinosachites are probably synonymous with Thambetolepis, which was originally described from Australia.
Left-hand and right-hand sclerites exist, so the animal was bilaterally symmetrical; as in Halkieria, palmate, cultrate and siculate sclerite morphologies exist.  The chambers are the same diameter, ~40 µm, as the longitudinal canals in Australohalkieria; their greater number and arrangement as lateral rather than longitudinal bodies reflects the greater size of the Sinosachites sclerites, which measure about 1–2 mm in length.
