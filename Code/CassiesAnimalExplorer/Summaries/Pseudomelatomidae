Pseudomelatomidae is a family of predatory sea snails, marine gastropods included in the superfamily Conoidea (previously Conacea) and part of the Neogastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).In 1995 Kantor elevated the subfamily Pseudomelatominae to the status of family Pseudomelatomidae. In 2011 Bouchet, Kantor et al. moved the Crassispirinae and Zonulispirinae and numerous genera of snails loosely called turrid snails (which at that point had been placed in the family Conidae) and placed them in the family Pseudomelatomidae.  This was based on a cladistical analysis of shell morphology, radular characteristics, anatomical characters, and a dataset of molecular sequences of three gene fragments.
