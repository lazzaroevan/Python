This is a list of the Opiliones or harvestmen of Trinidad and Tobago. Representatives of ten families are currently known to live on Trinidad, the information on Tobago is still sparse.
Goodnight and Goodnight produced one of the first listings of Trinidad opiliones in 1947 in a paper in which they named several new species. In Kury's 2003 catalogue of New World opiliones Trinidad was covered as well. The most recent work was done by Townsend, Proud and Moore in 2008 and included several new species that are still awaiting identification.
