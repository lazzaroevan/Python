The grey-crested cacholote (Pseudoseisura unirufa) is a species of bird in the family Furnariidae. It is sometimes known as the rufous cacholote, but this is potentially confusing, as this name also was used for the "combined" species when P. unirufa was considered a subspecies of P. cristata. It is mainly found in semi-open habitats in the Pantanal-region in Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, but also occurs in north-central Bolivia.
