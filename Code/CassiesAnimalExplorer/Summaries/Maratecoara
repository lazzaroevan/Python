Maratecoara is a genus of killifish in the family Rivulidae. These annual killifish are endemic to seasonal pools, swamps and lagoons in the upper Araguaiaâ€“Tocantins and middle Xingu river basins in Brazil. Most are from savanna regions, but M. gesmonei is from the Amazon rainforest.They are small fish, up to 5 cm (2.0 in) in total length. The males are mottled or spotted orange-red and turquoise-blue, and have long, pointed fins. The much duller females have "normal" fins.
