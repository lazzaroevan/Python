Astatotilapia flaviijosephi, the Jordan mouthbrooder, is a  vulnerable species of freshwater fish in the family Cichlidae (cichlids). It is found in the central Jordan River system, including Lake Tiberias (Kinneret), in Israel, Jordan and Syria, making it the only haplochromine cichlid to naturally range outside of Africa. This species is too small to be of significant importance to fisheries, unlike the only other cichlids native to the Levant, the economically important tilapias (Oreochromis aureus, O. niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Coptodon zillii and Tristramella).The specific name flaviijosephi refers to the historian Titus Flavius Josephus (37â€“c. 100 CE).
