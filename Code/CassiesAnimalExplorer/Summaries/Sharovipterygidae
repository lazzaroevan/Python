Sharovipterygidae is a family of strange gliding protorosaurians from the mid-Triassic of Eurasia, notable for their short forelimbs and long, wing-like hindlimbs, which supported membranes for gliding. They are represented by Sharovipteryx and Ozimek volans.A 2019 phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ozimek, and by extension Sharovipteryx, may belong to the Tanystropheidae.
