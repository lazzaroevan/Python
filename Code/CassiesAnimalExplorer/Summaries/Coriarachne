Coriarachne is a genus of crab spiders that was first described by Tamerlan Thorell in 1870. Over half of described species have been synonymized or moved to similar genera, including Bassaniana, Bassaniodes, and Pycnaxis.They are found in boreal and temperate regions almost exclusively on tree bark, wooden fence posts and similar areas where they can take advantage of their natural camouflage. They are rather slow-moving and robust, with the crab-like appearance characteristic of the subfamily Thomisinae. Similar to others in its subfamily, they will wait to ambush their prey rather than actively pursuing it. Often these spiders will congregate under loose bark, leaf litter, or similar situations to spend the winter either in the adult or penultimate stage.
