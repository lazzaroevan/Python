Coleophora trigeminella is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in most of Europe, except Ireland, the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands.
The larvae feed on snowy mespilus (Amelanchier ovalis), Cotoneaster, midland hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), European crab apple (Malus sylvestris), wild cherry (Prunus avium), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), common whitebeam (Sorbus aria) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). They create a reddish-brown, tubular silken case of 5–6 mm. The case is weakly constricted near the anal end, and strongly just behind the mouth. The mouth angle is 0°. Normally, the fully developed case is trivalved. The larvae are found on the underside of the leaf. Fully developed cases can be found in late April and early May.
