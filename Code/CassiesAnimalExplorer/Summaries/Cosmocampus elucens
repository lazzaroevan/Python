Cosmocampus elucens (shortfin pipefish, or Poey's pipefish) is a species of marine fish of the family Syngnathidae. It is found in the western Atlantic, off the U.S. east coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico, throughout the Caribbean Sea, and off the coast of Brazil. It lives in seagrass and algae beds, typically at shallow depths (although it has been found at depths up to 78 metres (256 ft)), where it can grow to lengths of 15 centimetres (5.9 in). It is expected to feed on small crustaceans, similar to other pipefishes. This species is ovoviviparous, with males carrying eggs and giving birth to live young.
