Astigmatina is a cohort of mites in the subclass Acari, mites and ticks. Astigmata has been ranked as an order or suborder in the past, but was lowered to the cohort Astigmatina of the supercohort Desmonomatides (synonym Desmonomata) in the suborder Oribatida (formerly Cryptostigmata), of the order Sarcoptiformes. Astigmatina is now made up of the two groups Acaridia and Psoroptidia, which have been suborders of the order Astigmata in the past. Astigmatina contains about 10 superfamilies and 76 families under Acaridia and Psoroptidia.Astigmatina belongs to the Sarcoptiformes, which contains the "biting" Acariformes. Many species are parasites of vertebrates. Most notorious among these are the Psoroptidia, which contain such notable taxa as feather mites and Sarcoptes scabiei.
