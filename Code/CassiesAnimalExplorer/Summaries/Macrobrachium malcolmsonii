Macrobrachium malcolmsonii (Milne-Edwards, 1844) is an omnivorous bottom dwelling fresh water prawn. Common name of this prawn is monsoon river prawn.It feeds on decomposing plants and animals, small worms, insects and their larvae. They are also cannibalistic in nature and may consume freshly molted conspecifics. In Asian countries particularly in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh the freshwater prawn species Macrobrachium malcolmsonii, M. rosenbergii and M. gangeticum are of special interest for aquaculture. M. malcolmsonii is nocturnal in habit and feed more actively at night. Being an indigenous fresh water river species M. malcolmsonii is more tolerant to environmental fluctuations and comparatively more resistant to contaminants. Males grow bigger than females, and even in the same sex there exists heterogeneity in growth. Those that grow faster tend to become dominant, while others remain stunted
