Phazaca kellersi is a species of moth of the family Uraniidae first described by Tams in 1935. It is found in Samoa and was described by two specimen from Tutuila collected by H.C. Kellers.
This species has a wingspan of 25 mm. The forewings are tilleul (pale yellowish green) buff, appearing pale brownish drab owing to the fuscous tips of numerous scattered scales, sometimes so arranged as to form obscure transverse strigulae. There is an indistinct, fine antemedial fascia and an indistinct amber brown postmedial fascia, possibly ending in the sharply oblique streak on the inner margin at three-quarters. The inner marginal extremities of both the antemedial and postmedial fasciae together give the appearance of a semi-circular mark. There is a pre-terminal series of velvety bone-brown dashes. The hindwings are similar in colour to the forewing, with a bowed antemedial fascia and an angled postmedial fascia, as well as velvety bone brown pre-terminal dashes preceded by some opalescent scaling.
