Peligrotherium is an extinct dryolestoid, and the sole member of the family Peligrotheriidae, from the Paleocene of Patagonia, originally interpreted as a stem-ungulate (though it did co-exist with early meridiungulates). Its remains have been found in the Salamanca Formation. It was a dog-sized mammal, among the largest of all dryolestoids, and closely related to mesungulatids, another lineage of large sized herbivorous dryolestoids. A recent phylogenetic study finds it to be the sister taxon to Reigitherium.
