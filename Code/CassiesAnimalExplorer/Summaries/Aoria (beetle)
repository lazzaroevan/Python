Food plants are known for only a few species, all of which were recorded from Vitaceae.Four genera similar to Aoria are known: Aloria, Enneaoria, Osnaparis and Pseudaoria. Osnaparis is regarded as a subgenus of Aoria by some researchers. In a revision of the genus Aoria in 2012, L. N. Medvedev included both Osnaparis and Pseudaoria as subgenera of Aoria, and treated Enneaoria as a synonym of Aloria.
