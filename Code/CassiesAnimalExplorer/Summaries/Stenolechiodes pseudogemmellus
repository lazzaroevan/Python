Stenolechiodes pseudogemmellus is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It is known from Germany, Greece, Italy, Austria, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Turkey, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Croatia.
The wingspan is 8â€“10 mm. Adults are on wing from the end of April to the start of July in one generation in central Europe. In south-eastern Europe, there is probably a second generation since adults were also collected in July in Italy, Greece and Montenegro.
The larva feed on Quercus species, including Quercus robur. They feed in the young shoots. They cause withered leaves and occasionally swellings. Pupation normally takes place in the shoot, but occasionally outside.
