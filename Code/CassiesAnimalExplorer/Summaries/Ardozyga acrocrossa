It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland.The wingspan is 10–14 mm (0.39–0.55 in). The forewings are grey sprinkled with fuscous. The apical third is more strongly suffused with fuscous and there are two discal dots obscurely indicated at one-third and two-thirds, rarely another dot beneath the latter. There is also a dark fuscous line or dotted chain along the apical fourth of the costa and around the apex and upper part of the termen. The hindwings are pale grey, towards the base whitish-ochreous.
