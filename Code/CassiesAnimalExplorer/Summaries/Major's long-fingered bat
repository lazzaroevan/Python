Major's long-fingered bat (Miniopterus majori) is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae.
It is found only in Madagascar. It is similar to M. schreibersi of Africa, differing by having a shorter forearm, slightly longer digits and a narrow box-shaped skull. The pelage is often a greyish brown colour, and the tragus is kidney-shaped and is a prominent feature. The species was named in honor of Swiss zoologist C. I. Forsyth Major.
