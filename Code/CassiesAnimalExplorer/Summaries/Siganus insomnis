Siganus insomnis, the bronze-lined spinefoot, is a species of rabbitfish. Like all rabbitfishes, it has venomous spines on the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins. It is found in the northern Indian Ocean off southern India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. It had formerly been confused with S. lineatus, but was recognized as a separate species in 2014.
