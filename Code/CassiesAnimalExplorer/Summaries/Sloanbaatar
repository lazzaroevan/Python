Sloanbaatar is a mammal genus that lived in Mongolia during the Upper Cretaceous. It lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. This animal was a member of the also extinct order  Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and the family Sloanbaataridae.
The genus Sloanbaatar was named by Kielan-Jaworowska, Z. in 1970. The name means "Sloan's hero", in honour of paleontologist R.E. Sloan.
Fossil remains of the only known species, Sloanbaatar mirabillis, have been found in the Coniacian - Santonian (Upper Cretaceous)-age strata of the Djadokhta Formation in Mongolia.
