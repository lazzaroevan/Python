Pseudanophthalmus packardi is a species of beetle found only in the Carter Caves of Kentucky. Individuals are blind and predatory, and remain close to underground streams in caves. They were first discovered in the X Cave in the late 1800s, but were mistaken for another species until Thomas C. Barr discovered its uniqueness in 1957.
