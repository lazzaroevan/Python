Parnassius nandadevinensis  is a high-altitude butterfly which is found only on Mt Nanda Devi, India. It is a member of the snow Apollo genus (Parnassius) of the swallowtail family (Papilionidae). It was described on the basis of a single worn specimen. The genitalia are said to be intermediate in structure between P. acdestis and P. stoliczkanus and could possibly represent an aberrant specimen of either.
