The Shorttail snake eel (Callechelys guineensis) is an eel in the family Ophichthidae (worm/snake eels). It was described by Balthazar Os√≥rio in 1893, originally under the genus Ophichthys. It is a marine, tropical eel which is known from the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, including Florida, USA, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, the Bahamas, St. Barthelemy, Senegal, Lesser Antilles, and Cape Verde. It dwells at a depth range of 4 to 35 metres (13 to 115 ft), and inhabits the continental shelf, where it forms burrows in sand and mud. Males can reach a maximum total length of 108 centimetres (43 in).
