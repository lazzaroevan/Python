The spitfire sawfly (Perga affinis, family Pergidae) is a hymenopteran insect found in Australia. It is up to 22 mm long. It has two pairs of wings, with a wingspan up to 40 mm. Its wings are honey colored. Its larvae are up to 80 mm long, and somewhat resemble a caterpillar.
The sawfly derives its name from the saw-like ovipositor of the female, which is used to open holes in the plant within which she lays her eggs. While closely related to wasps, sawflies lack both the narrow waist and sting of the wasp.
Although the adults of this sawfly species are not often seen the larvae are quite conspicuous as they grow larger, resembling hairy caterpillars. Steelblue sawfly larvae are usually seen during the day in groups on the branches and stems of Eucalyptus trees. At night they disperse to eat leaves of the host plant. When threatened the larvae will raise their head and eject a strong-smelling yellow-green liquid consisting predominantly of eucalyptus oil, to deter predators. This action gives them their common name of 'spitfires'.
