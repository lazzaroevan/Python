Coleophora ochripennella is a species of moth from the family Coleophoridae. It is found from Germany and Poland to the Pyrenees, Italy and Greece.

The larvae feed on Ballota nigra, Glechoma hederacea, Lamium album, Lamium purpureum, Stachys officinalis and Stachys sylvatica. They create a hairy, slender, largely dark brown lobe case of 8 to 10 millimetres (0.31 to 0.39 in) long. The mouth angle is 80 to 90 degrees, and the case is slightly compressed. Larvae can be found from October to May.
