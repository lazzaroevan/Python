The Seychelles wolf snake (Lycognathophis seychellensis) is a species of snake in the family Colubridae. It is monotypic within the genus Lycognathophis. The New Latin name, Lycognathophis, is derived from the Greek words λύκος (lykos) meaning "wolf", γνάθος (gnathos) meaning "jaw", and όφις (ophis) meaning "snake", referring to the snake's dentition.
