The Peruvian racket-tail (Ocreatus peruanus) is a species of hummingbird.  It is found on the east slope of the Andes in Ecuador and northeastern Peru.  It previously was considered conspecific with the white-booted racket-tail and the rufous-booted racket-tail, together called the booted racket-tail. In fact, many taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to lump the species together.
