The cynodonts ("dog teeth") (clade Cynodontia) are a clade of therapsids that first appeared in the Late Permian (approximately 260 Ma), and extensively diversified after the Permianâ€“Triassic extinction event. Cynodonts had a wide variety of lifestyles, including carnivory and herbivory. Mammals (including humans) are cynodonts, as are their extinct ancestors and close relatives, having evolved from advanced probainognathian cynodonts during the Late Triassic. All other cynodont lines went extinct, with the last known non-mammalian cynodont group, the Tritylodontidae having its last records in the Early Cretaceous.
