Phyllobates aurotaenia is a member of the frog family Dendrobatidae, which are found in the tropical environments of Central and South America. First described by zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1913, P. aurotaenia is known for being the third most poisonous frog in the world. It is the smallest of the poison dart frogs in the Phyllobates genus and is endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia.Wild specimens store batrachotoxin in glands in their skin, which can be fatal to humans in doses as small as 100 Âµg. The unique lethality of their poison is a trait often exploited by certain Native American peoples of Colombia for hunting.
The members of this species are characterized by: black dorsums, sometimes covered by orange suffusions; green, yellow, orange, or brownish gold dorsolateral stripes; and black abdomens with blue or green dots. The name Phyllobates aurotaenia is currently applied to two forms: a smaller, large-stripe form and a larger, small-stripe form. These forms are separated by a ravine yet retain the ability to interbreed.
The number and range of P. aurotaenia is declining, primarily due to loss of habitat,  and is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN.
