Conus navarroi is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. From its morphology and radular characters, it seems an evolutionary line different from other Capeverdian Conus species.The former subspecies Conus navarroi calhetae Rolán, 1990 is a synonym of Conus calhetae Rolán, 1990.
