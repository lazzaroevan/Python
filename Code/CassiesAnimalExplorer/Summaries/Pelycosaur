The pelycosaurs (pronounced PEL-ih-ko-saurz) were previously considered an order, but are now only an informal grouping composed of basal or primitive Late Paleozoic synapsids, sometimes called "mammal-like reptiles". They consist of all synapsids excluding the therapsids and their descendants.
Because more advanced synapsid group therapsida evolved directly from the pelycosaurs, the pelycosaurs are paraphyletic. Thus the name "pelycosaurs," similar to the term "mammal-like reptiles," had fallen out of favor among scientists by the 21st century, and is only used informally, if at all, in the modern scientific literature.
