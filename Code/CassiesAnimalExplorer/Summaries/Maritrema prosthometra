Maritrema prosthometra is a parasitic fluke from North America. It was first described in 1969 from the intestine of the clapper rail (Rallus crepitans) in eastern North America. Later, it was also found in the small intestine of 5% of a sample of marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) collected in a salt marsh at Cedar Key, Florida, where it used the fiddler crab Uca pigilator as an intermediate host.
