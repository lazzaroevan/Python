Fibrobacteres is a small bacterial phylum which includes many of the major rumen bacteria, allowing for the degradation of plant-based cellulose in ruminant animals. Members of this phylum were categorized in other phyla.  The genus Fibrobacter (the only genus of Fibrobacteres) was removed from the genus Bacteroides in 1988.
