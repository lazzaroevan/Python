Parbatthorax is a genus of spider, with a single species Parbatthorax unicornis. The genus and species were first described in 2019 by A. V. Tanasevitch. As of February 2019 it is represented by a male specimen discovered in the Nepal Himalayas. Its appearance resembles members of Gongylidioides and Glebala, but it can be distinguished by the unique shape of its carapace and a highly modified palpal tibia and paracymbium. The genus name is a reference to the Parbat District, where the first specimen was found, and the thorax, whose unique shape is one of its distinguishing factors.
