The flutist wren (Microcerculus ustulatus) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is restricted to humid highland forest in the Tepui region of northern Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela.
As is the case with all members of the genus Microcerculus, it is highly vocal, but otherwise furtive and difficult to see.
