Cybaeopsis is a genus of tangled nest spiders first described by Embrik Strand in 1907, and transferred from Agelenidae to Amaurobiidae by Pekka T. Lehtinen in 1967. They all occur in North America except for C. typica, found in Russia and Japan.Members of this genus closely resemble those of the genus Callobius, especially the females. It is considered a senior synonym of Callioplus, but not of Alauximus, which is a synonym of Tugana.
