Scythris zeugmatica is a moth of the family Scythrididae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931. It is found in Brazil (Santarem).The wingspan is about 10 mm. The forewings are rather dark purple-grey with a rather broad suffused yellow-whitish streak along the fold throughout, crossed at its middle by a fasciate bar reaching the dorsum but not reaching the costa, beyond this attenuated and indistinct, but expanded into an oval spot on the tornus, a somewhat inwards-oblique spot on the costa, towards the apex rather beyond this. The hindwings are grey.
