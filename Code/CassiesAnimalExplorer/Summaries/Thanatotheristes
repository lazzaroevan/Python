Thanatotheristes (meaning "reaper of death" according to the original authors; literally, "death harvester" in Greek: Θάνατος, romanized: Thánatos, "Death" and θεριστής, romanized: theristḗs, "harvester") is a genus of tyrannosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Laramidia, approximately 80.1-79.5 Ma. Thanatotheristes contains only one species, T. degrootorum, which may actually be the same animal as Daspletosaurus. Fossils of this taxon are found in the Foremost Formation of Alberta, Canada, coexisting with medium-sized ceratopsids like Xenoceratops foremostensis and small pachycephalosaurids like Colepiocephale lambei.
