Coleophora repentis is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in the Alps and the Tatra Mountains.
The larvae feed on Gypsophila repens. Young larvae create a broad corridor mine. The first case is made out of this mine. Later, they make large fleck mines that may occupy three quarters of the leaf surface. To do this, they have to leave their case. Before moving to a new leaf they make a new case out of the old mine. The case is a trivalved tubular leaf case of 4-6.5 mm long with a mouth angle of about 40Â°.
