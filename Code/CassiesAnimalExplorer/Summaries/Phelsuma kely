Phelsuma kely is a species of diurnal gecko which lives on the central east coast of Madagascar, south of Tamatave. It typically inhabits dragon trees. The gecko feeds on insects and probably nectar.
Little is known of this species, and it is known only from a single locality. It was first scientifically described in 2004. The IUCN declines to classify it as endangered or otherwise, citing "no information on its distribution, population status or threats".
