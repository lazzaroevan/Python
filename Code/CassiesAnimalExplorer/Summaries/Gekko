Gekko is a genus of Southeast Asian geckos, commonly known as true geckos or calling geckos, in the family Gekkonidae. Although species such as Gekko gecko (tokay gecko) are very widespread and common, some species in the same genus have a very small range and are considered rare or endangered. Fossils, including  Yantarogekko, date back to the Eocene.
