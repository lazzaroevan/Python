Astreopora listeri is a species of hard coral found in shallow water in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is an uncommon species with a wide range and is tolerant of turbid water, making it more resilient than some other corals to habitat disturbance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of "least concern".
