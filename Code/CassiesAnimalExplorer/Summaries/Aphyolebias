Aphyolebias is a genus of New World killifish from the family Rivulidae. Although this genus is recognised by Fishbase  In 1998, it was suggested that several species from the genus Moema be moved to the new Aphyolebias. Genetic research has indicated that Moema is paraphyletic and monophyly is only established when it is merged with the genus Aphyolebias. The Catalog of Fishes records Aphyolebias as a synonym of Moema.
