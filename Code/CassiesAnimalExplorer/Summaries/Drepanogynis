Drepanogynis is a genus in the geometer moth family (Geometridae). Long considered to hold about 5 dozen species, this number has been doubled after the last major revision. They are stout-bodied and hairy by geometer moth standards, usually have pale hindwings and rest with their wings angled upwards like a roof, as Nacophorini do. The genus is by and large restricted to Africa south of the Equator, with most species occurring in southern Africa.This genus belongs to the subfamily Ennominae. Therein, its relationships are not quite clear, but they may indeed belong into the tribe Nacophorini. These they resemble in general appearance as mentioned above, as well as having an anellus with lateral processes, a simple rodlike uncus, a strong gnathos, simple valvae and an aedeagus with separate cornuti. Closely related genera seem to be Argyrophora, Hebdomophruda, Microligia and Pseudomaenas.
