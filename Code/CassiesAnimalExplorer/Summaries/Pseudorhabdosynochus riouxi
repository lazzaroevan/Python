Pseudorhabdosynochus riouxi is a species of diplectanid monogenean parasitic on the gills of dusky grouper Mycteroperca marginata. It was described by Guy Oliver in 1986 as Cycloplectanum riouxi, then transferred to the genus Pseudorhabdosynochus by Santos, Buchmann & Gibson in 2000.
The species has been redescribed by Chaabane et al. in 2017.
