The spot-billed toucanet (Selenidera maculirostris) is a species of bird in the toucan family Ramphastidae. It is found in the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil, far eastern Paraguay, and far north-eastern Argentina (Misiones). The spot-billed toucanet was originally described in the genus Pteroglossus. It is 35 cm (14 in) long and weighs 140-200 grams (4.9-7.1 oz.) Except for the bill-pattern, it resembles the Gould's toucanet, and the two have been considered conspecific in the past.
Males can be differentiated from females by the color of the head, throat and chest. Males are black while females vary from brown to orange. The back of both sexes is olive green.
