The spotted trunkfish (Lactophrys bicaudalis) is a member of the family Ostraciidae. It can be found in reefs throughout the Caribbean, as well as the south western Atlantic Ocean. The species gets its name from the black spots it has covered over its whitish or yellow-golden body. In many Caribbean countries, it is colloquially known as box-fish or cow-fish.
