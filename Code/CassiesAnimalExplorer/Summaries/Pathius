Pathius is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is known from Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.
The genus was originally named Taphius by Martin Jacoby in 1897; however, this name was preoccupied by Taphius Adams, 1855 (a genus in Mollusca, currently a synonym of Biomphalaria Preston, 1910) and Taphius Rafinesque, 1815 (a nomen nudum genus in Crustacea), so it was renamed to Pathius by N. A. Aslam in 1968.
