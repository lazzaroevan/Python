Cretamystilus (meaning "Cretaceous Mystilus") is an extinct genus of mirid insect in the tribe Tingidae known from a fossil preserved in a piece of Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) Burmese amber from the Hukawng Valley (?), Myanmar. Cretamystilus, which was the first extinct genus to be named in 2021, contains a single species, C. herczeki. Cretamystilus is the first member of the Miridae in the fossil record known to date. It probably had a host association with bamboo plants, which is only hypothesized, and morphological characters of the holotype and similarity to the extant genus Mystilus (Distant, 1904) are also present in Cretamystilus.
