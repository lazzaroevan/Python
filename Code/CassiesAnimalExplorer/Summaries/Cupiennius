Cupiennius, known by the common name banana spiders, is a genus of araneomorph spiders in the family Trechaleidae, named by Eug√®ne Simon in 1891. They are found from Mexico to northwestern South America, and on some Caribbean islands. Unlike the dangerously venomous Phoneutria, bites from these spiders typically have only minor effects on humans, and have been compared to a bee sting.Members of this genus come in a range of sizes, from cephalothorax lengths less than 9 mm (0.35 in) to large species, with a cephalothorax length of 40 mm (1.6 in). The larger species are sometimes found far outside their native ranges in shipments of fruits, where they are frequently confused with Phoneutria spiders.
