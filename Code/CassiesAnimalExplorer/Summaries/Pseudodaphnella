Pseudodaphnella is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Raphitomidae.In the past this generic name, Pseudodaphnella, has been refused recognition by most modern writers, who have distributed its constituents among Mangilia, Clathurella, or Daphnella.This genus has a morphological close relationship to Kermia. Together they form a homogeneous complex. Both are also close to the conoidean genera Exomilus Hedley, 1918, Paramontana Laseron, 1954 and Thetidos Hedley, 1899
