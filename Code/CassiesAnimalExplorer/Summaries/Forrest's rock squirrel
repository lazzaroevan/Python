The Forrest's rock squirrel (Sciurotamias forresti) is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is endemic to Sichuan and Yunnan in China, where it inhabits cliffs covered in shrubby vegetations at an approximate altitude of 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). Relatively little is known about the Forrest's rock squirrel, but it is presumed the behavior resembles that of its more widespread relative, the Père David's rock squirrel. In appearance it largely resembles Père David's rock squirrel, but the Forrest's rock squirrel is more ochraceous in colour and has a faint whitish line on the side.
