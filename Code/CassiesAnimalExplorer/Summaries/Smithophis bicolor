The brown trapezoid snake (Smithophis bicolor) is a species of snake found in India (Assam, Meghalaya; Arunachal Pradesh (Deban, Namdapha - Changlang district)), North Myanmar (Burma), and China (West Yunnan). While formerly classified under the genus Rhabdops, a study published in 2019 found it to belong to the new genus Smithophis.
