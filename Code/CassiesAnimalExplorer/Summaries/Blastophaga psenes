Blastophaga psenes is a wasp species in the genus Blastophaga. It pollinates the common fig Ficus carica and the closely related Ficus palmata. Without a colony or nest, these wasps breed in figs and live for only a few days or weeks.   They locate the fig they wish to pollinate through olfactory senses.
