This butterfly is the only carnivorous (i.e., insectivorous) butterfly in North America (there are a handful of carnivorous  moths, for example Fulgoraecia exigua). The larvae feed on various aphids, such as Neoprociphilus, Pemphigus, Prociphilus, and Schizoneura. 
It is found in early spring until fall and is generally scarce. It lives in wooded areas near streams close to alders.The wingspan is 23â€“32 mm.Another butterfly which is possibly carnivorous is Celastrina serotina. It feeds on galls on  black cherry and possibly also on the eriophid mites that make the galls.
