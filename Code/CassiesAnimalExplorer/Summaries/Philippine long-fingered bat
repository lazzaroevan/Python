The Philippine long-fingered bat (Miniopterus paululus) is a species of bat from the family Miniopteridae. The species is listed as "Data Deficient" on the IUCN Red List due to lack of information about population, ecology, distribution, and threats. The Philippine long-fingered bat is native to Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Timor-Leste. Due to the dubious taxonomic status of the Philippine long-fingered bat, it has been suggested that the species remain classified as a subspecies of the little bent-wing bat.
