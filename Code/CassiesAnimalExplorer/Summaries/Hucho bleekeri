Hucho bleekeri, or the Sichuan taimen, is a species of freshwater fish in the salmon family (Salmonidae), endemic to the Yangtze basin in China. 
Their typical habitat includes mountain streams and small rivers, typically being found in the catchment areas of the Dadu River in Sichuan and Qinghai Provinces, as well as the Hanjiang River. This particular fish population is largely threatened by habitat loss and illegal fishing, resulting in a "critically endangered" conservation status from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
