The Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus), also known commonly as the African giant pouched rat, is a species of nocturnal pouched rat of the giant pouched rat genus Cricetomys, in the family Nesomyidae. The species is among the largest muroids in the world, growing up to about 0.9 metres (3 ft) long including the tail which makes up half of its total length.  It is widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa, ranging geographically from Senegal to Kenya and from Angola to Mozambique (although it is absent from much of the DR Congo, where Emin's pouched rat is present) and in altitude from sea level to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft).The Gambian pouched rat is sometimes kept as  pet, but some have escaped from captivity and become an invasive species in Florida. The CDC and FDA in the US now ban the importation of this species because it is blamed for the 2003 outbreak of monkeypox.
