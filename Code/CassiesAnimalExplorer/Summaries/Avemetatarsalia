Avemetatarsalia (meaning "bird metatarsals") is a clade name established by British palaeontologist Michael Benton in 1999 for all crown group archosaurs that are closer to birds than to crocodilians. An alternate name is Panaves, or "all birds", in reference to its definition containing all animals, living or extinct, which are more closely related to birds than to crocodilians. Almost all avemetatarsalians are members of a similarly defined subgroup, Ornithodira. Ornithodira is defined as the last common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and all of its descendants.Members of Avemetatarsalia include the Dinosauromorpha, Pterosauromorpha, the genus Scleromochlus, and Aphanosauria. Dinosauromorpha contains more basal forms, such as silesaurids and Marasuchus, as well as more derived forms, including dinosaurs. Birds (Aves) belong to the dinosaurs, specifically as members of the dinosaur subgroup Theropoda.Pterosauromorpha primarily contains Pterosauria, which were the first vertebrates capable of true flight. Lagerpetids, a family of long-legged but incompletely known avemetatarsalians, have traditionally been considered dinosauromorphs, but may be pterosauromorphs instead. Aphanosauria is a Triassic group of gracile carnivorous quadrupeds; in 2017, aphanosaurs were recognized as the first major group of non-ornithodiran avemetatarsalians.
