Lumbricus terrestris is a large, reddish worm species thought to be native to Western Europe, now widely distributed around the world (along with several other lumbricids), particularly in temperate to mild boreal climates. In some areas where it is an introduced species, some people consider it to be a significant pest for out-competing native worms. It has an odd habit of copulating on the surface at night, making it more visible than most other earthworms.Through much of Europe, it is the largest naturally occurring species of earthworm, typically reaching 20 to 25 cm in length when extended (though in parts of southern Europe, the native species are much larger).
