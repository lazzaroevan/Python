Austrothelphusa transversa (von Martens, 1868), also known as the freshwater crab, inland crab, or tropical freshwater crab is a species of freshwater crab endemic to Australia. A. transversa is the most dispersed species out of this genus as it has adaptations that allow it to have a higher tolerance to drought and arid conditions.
