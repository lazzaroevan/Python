Stenoma aterpes is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Lord Walsingham in 1913. It is found in Veracruz, Mexico.The wingspan is about 32 mm. The forewings are fawn grey, with a slight tawny gloss. Two small fuscous spots, one at the end of the cell, preceded by a diffused streak of rather paler fawn, which is repeated along the base of the costa; a second in the fold, rather beyond its middle, surrounded by the same paler fawn colour. A faintly darker shade of tawny fawn grey crosses the wing, leaving the costa at two-thirds, obtusely angulated outward opposite to the middle of the termen and reverting to the dorsum before the tornus. The hindwings are dark brownish grey.
