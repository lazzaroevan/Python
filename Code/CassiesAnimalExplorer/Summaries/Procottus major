Procottus major is one of the four recognized species of the deepwater sculpin fish genus Procottus, endemic to Lake Baikal in Russia. It was originally described as a subspecies of the similar but smaller red sculpin (P. jeittelesii). P. major can be found at depths of up to 900 m (3,000 ft), especially on a muddy or rocky-mud bottom. In the spring and summer it typically occurs deeper than 100 m (330 ft), and in the fall and winter from 30 to 200 m (98–656 ft). It can reach a length of 30 cm (12 in), but is usually 18–22 cm (7.1–8.7 in). It feeds on smaller animals, especially gammarids, and breeding occurs in the winter at depths of 60–140 m (200–460 ft). This species is fished and its young are an important food source for other fish.
