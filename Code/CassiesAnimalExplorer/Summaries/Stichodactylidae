Stichodactylidae is a family of sea anemones that contains the genera Stichodactyla (carpet anemones) and Heteractis.  These sea anemones exclusively reside within the shallow waters of the tropical Indo-Pacific area and are in the main family of sea anemones that hosts several varieties of clownfishes. Most sea anemone species are harmless to humans, but at least some Stichodactyla are highly venomous and their sting may cause anaphylactic shock and organ failure (notably acute liver failure). In contrast, the venom of Heteractis  has shown potential in treatment of lung cancer.
