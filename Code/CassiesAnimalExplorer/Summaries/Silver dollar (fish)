Silver dollar is a common name given to a number of species of fishes, mostly in the genus Metynnis, tropical fish belonging to the family Characidae which are closely related to piranha and pacu. Native to South America, these somewhat round-shaped silver fish are popular with fish-keeping hobbyists.
The silver dollar is a peaceful schooling species that spends most of its time in the mid- to upper-level of the  water.  Its average lifespan is than ten years but can live longer in captivity. A chin-layer, the adult fish will spawn around 2,000 eggs.  This breeding occurs in soft, warm water in low light.
Silver dollars natively live in a tropical climate in the sides of weedy rivers. They prefer water with a pH of 5–7, a water hardness of up to 15 dGH, and an ideal temperature range of 24–28 °C (75–82 °F). Their diet is almost exclusively vegetarian and in captivity they will often eat all the plants in a tank. They will also eat worms and small insects.
