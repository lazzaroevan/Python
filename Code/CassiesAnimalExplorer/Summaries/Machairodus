Machairodus is a genus of large machairodontine saber-toothed cats that lived in Africa and Eurasia during the late Miocene. It is the animal from which the subfamily Machairodontinae gets its name and has since become a wastebasket taxon over the years as many genera of sabertooth cat have been and are still occasionally lumped into it.
