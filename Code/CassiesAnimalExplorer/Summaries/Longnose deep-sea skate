The longnose deep-sea skate (Bathyraja shuntovi) is a large skate in the family Arhynchobatidae.  It was first described in 1985 from specimens collected near New Zealand.  It is known to be a deep-water skate, however lack of research trawls at depths past 1500 meters limits knowledge of the depths where the species can be found. The species is dark brown or grey, with an eponymous elongated snout.  The species has been measured to be a maximum of 140 cm in total length, although size variation and growth patterns are not known.
