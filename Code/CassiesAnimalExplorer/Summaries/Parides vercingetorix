Parides vercingetorix is a species of butterfly in the family Papilionidae. It is endemic to French Guiana. Formerly, this species was known as Parides coelus and originally described as Papilio coelus by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1836, but that name was already used in 1781 by Stoll for the butterfly now known as Aguna coelus. Consequently, the Parides species had to receive a new name.
