Feschaeria amycus is a moth in the Castniidae family. It has been recorded from Guyana, Brazil, Venezuela and Tobago.
The wingspan is about 70 mm. Adults are greyish brown with an irregular sinuous whitish band running from the mid-costal margin to the inner angle of the forewing. There is also a small sinuous white band at the apical region. The base of the hindwings is dark brown, but the anal margin is covered by long greenish-brown scales and an irregular black band is found at the central area of the hindwing. From here, a red band runs toward the costal margin, becoming spots at the end. There is also a row of red spots parallel to the external margin.
