Crossocheilus langei, also known as the red algae eater (but sold sometimes sold as "Siamese algae eater"), is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Crossocheilus. It is native to Malaysia and Sumatra. This bottom-dwelling tropical fish is found in mainland Southeast Asia. Its natural habitats are streams and rivers as well as flooded forests during the rainy season. It is often confused with the Crossocheilus oblongus, however, both are algae eaters and will behave similarly.
