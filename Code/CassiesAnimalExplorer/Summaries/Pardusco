The pardusco (Nephelornis oneilli) is a species of tanager that is endemic to woodland near the timberline in the Andes of central Peru. It is the only member of the genus Nephelornis. This small olive-brown bird is typically seen in groups, which sometimes join mixed species flocks. It has a small range, but is locally fairly common, and consequently considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN.
