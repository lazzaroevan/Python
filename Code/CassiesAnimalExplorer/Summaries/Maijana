Maijana is a monotypic genus of  araneomorph spiders in the family Tetrablemmidae containing the single species, Maijana rackae. It was first described by Pekka T. Lehtinen in 1981 from a single female found in bat guano in a Javanese cave of the Bogor Regency. Though it looks similar to Tetrablemma species, the structural parts, namely the epigyne, are unique enough to differentiate them.
