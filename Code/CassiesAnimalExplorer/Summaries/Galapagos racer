The Gal치pagos racer (Pseudalsophis biserialis or Philodryas biserialis) is a colubrid snake in the genus Pseudalsophis that is endemic to the Gal치pagos Islands. It is a mildly venomous constrictor but it is not considered aggressive or harmful to humans. The two subspecies are the eastern and western racers, the latter being larger, longer, and darker than the former. The western subspecies specializes in hunting fish, while both subspecies eat small reptiles, eggs, rodents, and bird hatchlings. The Galapagos racer is near threatened due to recently introduced species that feed on snake eggs, including pigs, rats, mice, and cats. It is one of only three species of snakes on the Gal치pagos Islands, and it was first described in 1860. In November 2016, a video clip from the BBC series Planet Earth II showing a group of Gal치pagos racers hunting marine iguana hatchlings became a viral trend.
