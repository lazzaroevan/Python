Asterophysus batrachus, the gulper catfish or ogre catfish, is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Auchenipteridae. It is native to the Rio Negro and Orinoco  basins in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, where mostly found in slow-moving waters with many submerged structures. It is currently the only recognized species of the genus Asterophysus, but a specimen that possibly represents an undescribed species has been collected in Maraj√≥ (about 1,200 km or 750 mi from the traditionally recognized range of A. batrachus).The gulper catfish grows to a standard length of 25 cm (9.8 in), and a total length of 28.5 cm (11.2 in). It has a short, thick-set shape and is dark-colored with a whitish belly. People in its native range typically will not eat it because they consider it very ugly, but it is sometimes kept in aquariums.
