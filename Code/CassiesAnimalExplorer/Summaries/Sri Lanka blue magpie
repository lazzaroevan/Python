The Sri Lanka blue magpie or Ceylon magpie (Urocissa ornata) is a brightly coloured member of the family Corvidae and found exclusively in Sri Lanka. This species is adapted to hunting in the dense canopy, where it is highly active and nimble. However, its flight is rather weak and rarely used to cover great distances.  In spite of the Sri Lanka blue magpie's ability to adapt to the presence of humans, it is classified as being vulnerable to extinction due to the fragmentation and destruction of its habitat of dense primary forest in the wet zone of Southern Sri Lanka.
