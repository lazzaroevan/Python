It is found in eastern and south-eastern Australia, from southern Queensland to Tasmania.The length of the forewings is 8–9 millimetres (0.31–0.35 in) for males. The head, thorax, abdomen and upperside of the forewing are dark greyish black with distinct bluish green sheen. The hindwings are dark grey-brown, sometimes with a weak blue-green sheen near the anal angle. The underside of both wings is dark grey-brown with a weak blue-green sheen on the forewing apically and on the hindwing along the costa apically.
