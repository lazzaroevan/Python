Papurana waliesa is a species of "true frogs", family Ranidae. It is endemic to Papua New Guinea where it is found in the southern Owen Stanley Range and the Pini Range in the eastern New Guinea as well as in the D'Entrecasteaux Islands (Fergusson, Goodenough, and Normanby islands). The specific name waliesa is derived from the Dobu word waliesa that means "namesake", in honor of Fred Malesa from Fergusson Island. He had greatly assisted the describers of this species during their expedition in the Milne Bay Province.
