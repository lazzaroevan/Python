Athrinacia xanthographa is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Lord Walsingham in 1911. It is found in Mexico, where it has been recorded from Guerrero.The wingspan is 13â€“14 mm. The forewings are lilac grey, with pale yellow bands and spots enclosing patches of yellowish brown these are distributed as follows: a yellow patch at the base is produced along the upper edge of the cell, emitting an ocelloid patch with brown centre which reaches to the dorsum at one-fourth, a central band of yellow encloses a small triangular brown spot on the costa and a larger dorsal spot slightly beyond it, a yellow spot lying between this and a third yellow band, crossing the wing before the costal cilia and enclosing an elongate brown patch and a small costal spot. Beyond this a brown costal spot occurs at the commencement of the costal cilia and is followed by a chain-like, wavy line, of brown around the apex and termen which is inwardly margined with yellow. A small yellow patch lies across the apical veins beyond the end of the cell, sometimes enclosing brown specks. The hindwings are pale greyish.
