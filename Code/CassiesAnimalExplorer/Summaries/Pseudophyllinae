The subfamily Pseudophyllinae contains numerous species in the family Tettigoniidae, the katydids or bush crickets. Sometimes called "true katydids", together with the crickets of suborder Ensifera, they form part of the insect order Orthoptera which also contains grasshoppers.
Members of the group are noted for their remarkable camouflage. They closely resemble dried leaves, including veins, various blotches and even bite marks.
