Siamogale melilutra is an extinct species of giant otter from the late Miocene from Yunnan province, China.
Ranking among the largest fossil otters, Siamogale represents a feeding ecomorphology with no living analog. Its giant size and high mandibular strength confer shell-crushing capability matched only by other extinct molluscivores, such as the marine bear Kolponomos.
