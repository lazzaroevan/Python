Arthroleptis lameerei is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is found in northeastern Angola, southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and western Burundi, though the exact range is poorly known. There is some doubt whether it is distinct from Arthroleptis xenochirus. The specific name lameerei honours Auguste Lameere, a Belgian entomologist. Common names Lameere's squeaker, Lameer's squeaker, and Katanga screeching frog have been coined for this species.
