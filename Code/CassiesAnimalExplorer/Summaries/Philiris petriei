Philiris petriei is a species of butterfly of the family Lycaenidae. It is found on New Britain in Papua New Guinea.

The length of the forewings is about 17.5 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is black, with a restricted triangular area of white in the median and postmedian area and a white area suffused with light grey narrowly towards the base. The underside is uniformly white, with apical area and termen broadly suffused with brown. The hindwings are black, the apical area white and extending along the costa to near the base and to the middle. There seem to be two generations per year with adults on wing in November and December and again in April and May.
The larvae feed on Litsea species.
