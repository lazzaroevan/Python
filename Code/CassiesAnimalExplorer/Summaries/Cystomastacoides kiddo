Cystomastacoides kiddo is a species of parasitoid wasp belonging to the family Braconidae. The species was found during a 2006-2008 insect collection programme in Thailand. The name is derived from the character Beatrix Kiddo from the 2003 film Kill Bill, because of their resemblance in action and colour. It is one of the four species under the genus Cystomastacoides, and the only species in Thailand. As all other braconids, the female lays its eggs inside the body of other insects, such as moth caterpillar, so that the larvae use the host body as a source of food.
