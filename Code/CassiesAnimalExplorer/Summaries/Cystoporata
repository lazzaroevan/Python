Cystoporata is an extinct order of Paleozoic bryozoans.  Their fossils are found from Ordovician to Triassic strata.
All cystoporatan bryozoan genera (around 50 or so) have a "cystopore," a chamber-like supporting structure, separated from each other by transverse septa, situated between the characteristically elongated zooecias of each individual colony.
