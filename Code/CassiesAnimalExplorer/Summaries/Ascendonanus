Ascendonanus (meaning "climbing dwarf") is an extinct genus of varanopid amniote from the Early Permian of Germany. It is the earliest specialized arboreal (tree-living) vertebrate currently known and resembled a small lizard, although it was related to mammals. The fossils of Ascendonanus are of special scientific importance because they include remains of skin, scales, scutes, bony ossicles, and body outlines, indicating that some of the oldest relatives of mammals had a scaly "reptilian-type" appearance. The animal was about 40 cm long, with strongly curved claws, short limbs, a slender, elongated trunk, and a long tail. It would have preyed on insects and other small arthropods.Ascendonanus was named and described in 2018 from remains of five individuals that were discovered in the Chemnitz petrified forest, an Early Permian tropical fossil forest preserved under the city of Chemnitz, Germany. A Pompeii-like pyroclastic volcanic eruption 291 million years ago buried the forest and created the Zeisigwald Tuff Horizon in the uppermost Leukersdorf Formation (late Sakmarian/early Artinskian transition stage), preserving some of the animals that lived there in exceptional detail in a bottom layer of volcanic ash.The type species name Ascendonanus nestleri honors Knut Nestler, a long-time local supporter (deceased) of the Chemnitz Museum of Natural History (Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Chemnitz (MNC)), where the specimens of Ascendonanus are stored.
