Cryptista is a clade of algae-like eukaryotes. It is sometimes placed along with Haptista in the group Hacrobia, within the kingdom Chromista.
However, in 2016, a broad phylogenomic study found that cryptists fall within the group Archaeplastida, while haptophytes are closely related to the SAR supergroup.
