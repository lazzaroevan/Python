Conwentzia is a genus of net-winged insects belonging to the family Coniopterygidae or dustywings. Conwentzia species are present in most of Europe.These tiny insects, also known as waxwing lacewings or dustywing lacewings. They have only vestigial hindwings. Body and forewings are covered with whitish dust of waxy scales which the insect produces itself. Forewings are carried nearly side-by-side when at rest, like many other Neuroptera.
To distinguish various species, an accurate study of the genitals by microscope is usually necessary.
