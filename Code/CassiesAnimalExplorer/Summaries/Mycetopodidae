The Mycetopodidae are a family of freshwater pearly mussels in the order Unionida restricted to South America.  They are named for the mushroom-like shape of their foot.  Like all members of the Unionida they reproduce via a larval stage that temporarily parasitizes fish.  Banarescu lists four subfamilies with ten genera in total.
