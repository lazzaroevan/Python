The cut-throat finch (Amadina fasciata) is a common species of estrildid finch found throughout Africa; it is also known as the bearded finch, the ribbon finch, the cut throat, and the weaver finch.
The cut-throat finch has plumage that is pale, sandy brown with flecks of black all over.  They have a black-brown tail, a thick white chin and cheeks, and a chestnut brown patch on the belly.  The legs are a pink fleshy colour.  The adult male has a bright red band across its throat (thus the name "cut throat"), while the male juveniles have a slightly duller red band.
It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 3,300,000 km2.  It is found throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the Sahel, eastern and southern parts of the continent.
