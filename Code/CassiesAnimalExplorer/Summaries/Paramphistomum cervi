Paramphistomum cervi, the type species of Paramphistomum, is a parasitic flat worm belonging to the class Trematoda. It is a tiny fluke mostly parasitising livestock ruminants, as well as some wild mammals. Uniquely, unlike most parasites, the adult worms are relatively harmless, but it is the developing juveniles that cause serious disease called paramphistomiasis (or classically amphistomosis), especially in cattle and sheep. Its symptoms include profuse diarrhoea, anaemia, lethargy, and often result in death if untreated.It is considered as worldwide in prevalence. It is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including Australia, Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Russia. The most debilitating cases are reported in Europe from Bulgaria, Italy, France, and Poland and also in Asia from Thailand, India, and China. The parasitic infection was first described from Punjab, India.
