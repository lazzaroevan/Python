The mangrove black hawk, Buteogallus anthracinus subtilis, is a neotropical bird of prey in the family Accipitridae native to South and Central America. Briefly treated as a distinct species, Buteogallus subtilis, recent evidence strongly suggests it should be considered a subspecies of the common black hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus).
