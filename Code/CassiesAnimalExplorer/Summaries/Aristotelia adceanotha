Aristotelia adceanotha is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Keifer in 1935. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from California and Washington.The wingspan is 11â€“12 mm. The basal area of the forewings is dark fuscous brown or blackish-brown on the costal side of the fold and bright brown on the dorsal side, the extreme base orange-roseate. The first fascia is a white band obliquely outward from the costal one-fifth with dark edging on the inner side, this fascia orange-roseate and somewhat obscure on the dorsum reaching the dorsal edge at one-fourth. The area beyond, the same as basal area, except the dorsum somewhat orange-roseate. The central fascia is widest, whitish costally with slight fuscous infusion, fading to orange-roseate on the dorsal side of the fold and with a sharp wedge of dark colour projecting nearly across the center of this fascia. There is dark costal colouring from this fascia on, limited to a line from the center of four-fifths of the wing, where it meets a bright orange-roseate tornal spot on the midline where they are more or less interrupted by a black spot. The apex and some spots on the outer margin are orange-roseate. The hindwings are whitish, somewhat infuscated.
The larvae feed on Ceanothus cuneatus. The larvae have a whitish head, lined and blotched with dark purple-fuscous. The body is dark fuscous-brown, slightly purplish. They reach a length of about 8 mm when full-grown.
