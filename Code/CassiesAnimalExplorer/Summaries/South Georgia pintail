The South Georgia pintail (Anas georgica georgica), also misleadingly known as the South Georgian teal, is the nominate subspecies of the yellow-billed pintail (Anas georgica), a duck in the dabbling duck subfamily Anatinae. It is endemic to the large (3,756 km2) subantarctic island of South Georgia and its accompanying archipelago, and is a vagrant to the South Sandwich Islands. It was among the birds noted by James Cook in January 1775, on the occasion of the first recorded landing on South Georgia, and was formerly considered a full species.
