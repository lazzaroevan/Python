The Marohita mouse lemur (Microcebus marohita) is a species of mouse lemur known only from the Marohita Forest in eastern Madagascar, near the village of Marolambo.  Specimens were first collected in December 2003, and its discovery was announced in 2013 along with the Anosy mouse lemur (Microcebus tanosi).  It is a large mouse lemur, weighing up to 89 g (3.1 oz), and lives within the same area as the Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara), Simmons' mouse lemur (M. simmonsi), and the brown mouse lemur (M. rufus), all four of which are nearly identical in appearance.  Its fur is rufous on its back and grayish-beige on its underside.  Nothing is known about its behavior.  Its conservation status was evaluated as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2012, before it was formally described, because its only known habitat had severely degraded between 2003 and 2012.
