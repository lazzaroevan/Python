The Death Domain database is a secondary database of protein-protein interactions (PPI) of the death domain superfamily. Members of this superfamily are key players in apoptosis, inflammation, necrosis, and immune cell signaling pathways. Negative death domain superfamily-mediated signaling events result in various human diseases which include, cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and immunological disorders. Creating death domain databases are of particular interest to researchers in the biomedical field as it enables a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in death domain interactions while also providing easy access to tools such as an interaction map that illustrates the protein-protein interaction network and information. There is currently only one database that exclusively looks at death domains but there are other databases and resources that have information on this superfamily. According to PubMed, this database has been cited by seven peer-reviewed articles to date because of its extensive and specific information on the death domains and their PPI summaries.
