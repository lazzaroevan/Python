The Aspidoceratidae comprise a family of middle and upper Jurassic ammonites that make up part of the superfamily Perisphinctoidea, characterized by evolute shells, commonly stocky, that tend to develop tubercles.
The Aspidoceratidae are thought to be derived from the Perisphinctidae and have been subdivided into three subfamilies, the Aspidoceratinae, Peltoceratinae, and Simoceratinae.
