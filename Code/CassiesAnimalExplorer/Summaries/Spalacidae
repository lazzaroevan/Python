The Spalacidae, or spalacids, are a family of rodents in the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. They are native to eastern Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and southeastern Europe. It includes the blind mole-rats, bamboo rats, mole-rats, and zokors.  This family represents the oldest split (excluding perhaps the Platacanthomyidae) in the muroid superfamily, and comprises animals adapted to a subterranean way of life.  These rodents were thought to have evolved adaptations to living underground independently until recent genetic studies demonstrated they form a monophyletic group.  Members of the Spalacidae are often placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the Muroidea.
