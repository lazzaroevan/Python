Lopodytes Rondani 1867 is a genus in the family Reduviidae, the assassin bugs. Members of the genus have been unofficially assigned the common name Grass Assassin bugs, but generally this name remains meaningful only to naturalists, because these insects have been too well camouflaged to raise robust public awareness.
