Physalaemus aguirrei is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae. It is endemic to eastern Brazil and occurs in the southern Bahia, northern Esp√≠rito Santo and northeastern Minas Gerais. The specific name aguirrei honours Alvaro Coutinho Aguirre, a Brazilian zoologist. However, common name Linhares dwarf frog has been proposed for it.
