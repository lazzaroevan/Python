Fritziana goeldii, also known as Goeldi's frog or Colonia Alpina treefrog, is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae. It is endemic to southeastern Brazil and found in Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, and São Paulo states. The species is named after Émil Goeldi, Swiss zoologist who worked in Brazil. Fritziana goeldii may be locally threatened by habitat destruction but over most of its range it is a common species with a large total population, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of "least concern".
