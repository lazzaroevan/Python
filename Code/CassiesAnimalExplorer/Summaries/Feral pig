The feral pig is a domestic pig which has gone feral (or was born feral, as offspring to feral parents), meaning it lives in the wild. They are found mostly in the Americas and Australia. In some countries, the terms razorback and wild hog are applied to feral pigs or boarâ€“pig hybrids. These animals are different from the indigenous New World pigs such as peccaries (javelinas), but their ranges in the Americas overlap.
