Litopterna (from Ancient Greek: λῑτή πτέρνα "smooth heel") is an extinct order of fossil hoofed mammals from the Cenozoic era. The order is one of the five great clades of South American ungulates that gave the continent a unique fauna until the Great American Biotic Interchange. Like other endemic South American mammals, their relationship to other mammal groups has long been unclear. 
There were two major groups of litopterns: Prototheriidae and Macraucheniidae. Prototherids were medium to large animals that evolved adaptations for fast running, and occupied a variety of niches that elsewhere were filled by animals such as goats and antelopes, mouse deer, and horses. Macrauchenids were large to very large animals with long necks; they evolved retracted nasal openings, indicating that a number of their species likely had a muscular upper lip or short trunk. They likely filled roles in the environment similar to camels, giraffes, sivatheres, and browsing rhinoceroses on other continents. Many types of litopterns were abundant in South American faunas, all ate plants, and the group reached its maximum diversity in the late Miocene. All litoperns displayed toe reduction – three-toed forms developed, and some prototherids had a single hoof on each foot.Together with Neolicaphrium, Macrauchenia was among the youngest genera of litopterns, and these two appear to have been the only members of the group to survive the Great American Biotic Interchange. Both became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. The genera that died out during this faunal exchange are presumed to have been driven to extinction at least in part by competition with invading North American ungulates.
