The spotfin lionfish or broadbarred firefish (Pterois antennata) is a fish found in the tropical Indian and Western Pacific Oceans; it grows to a maximum of 20 cm (8 in) and, like other lionfish, has venomous spiny dorsal fins.  Its typical habitat is in lagoons and reefs, where it hides during the day and hunts shrimp and crab at night.
