A parable is a succinct, didactic story, in prose or verse, that illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a fable in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters. A parable is a type of metaphorical analogy.Some scholars of the canonical gospels and the New Testament apply the term "parable" only to the parables of Jesus,
though that is not a common restriction of the term. Parables such as "The Prodigal Son" are important to Jesus's teaching-method in the canonical narratives and the apocrypha.
