The shortnose spurdog (Squalus megalops) also known as the piked spurdog is a small shark located primarily off the coast of Southern Australia and South Africa. The shortnose spurdog's size is dependent on the sex of the animal. The female shortnose spurdog is consistently larger than the male shortnose spurdog and will typically measure out to about 56.41 cm (1.85 ft) while the male shortnose spurdog will typically only measure out to about 44.36 cm in length (1.46 ft) which means the female shortnose spurdog is over 10 cm longer than the male shortnose spurdog. Some females can even measure up to 78 cm which is over 2.5 feet long. The life span of spurdog's can be quite long with females typically living longer than males. The average life span of a female shortnose spurdog is 0â€“29 years old while the male life span is 0-26 though it is estimated that a female can live up to 46 years while a male can only live up to 33. Females also take longer to reach sexual maturity than males and on average are not fertile until they are over 15 years of age. 7 years longer than the 8 years it takes males to reach maturity. The shortnose spurdog's eat a variety of items but primarily favor cephalopods such as squid and octopuses for their meals. Other organisms that have been found in their stomachs include fish, hermit crabs, sponges, brittle stars, the remains of sea lion and even primary producers such as algae.
