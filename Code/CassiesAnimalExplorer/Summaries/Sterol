Sterol is a chemical compound with formula C17H28O, whose molecule is derived from that of gonane by replacement of a hydrogen atom in position 3 by a hydroxyl group. It is therefore an alcohol of gonane. 
The name is also used generically for compounds that are derived from this one by substituting other chemical groups for some of the hydrogen atoms, or modifying the bonds in the ring.  
These sterols or steroid alcohols are a subgroup of the steroids and an important class of organic molecules. They occur naturally in plants, animals, and fungi, and can be also produced by some bacteria (however likely with different functions). The most familiar type of animal sterol is cholesterol, which is vital to cell membrane structure, and functions as a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones.
While technically alcohols, sterols are classified by biochemists as lipids (fats in the broader sense of the term).
