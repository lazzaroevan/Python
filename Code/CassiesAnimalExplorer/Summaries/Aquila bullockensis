Aquila bullockensis is an extinct species of large true eagles in the family Accipitridae.  A. bullockensis is related to the living species A. audax to which it might be ancestral.  The species is solely known from the distal end of a right humerus found in the Middle Miocene (about 12 Ma), Bullock Creek deposits in Australia.  A. bullockensis is the oldest confirmed record of the genus Aquila in Australia, and possibly in the world.
