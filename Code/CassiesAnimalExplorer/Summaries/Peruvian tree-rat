The Peruvian tree rat (Makalata rhipidura) is a species of rodent in the family Echimyidae. It is found in northeastern Peru and adjacent Ecuador, where it is found in the Amazon rainforest. It is nocturnal and arboreal.The etymology of the species name derives from the two ancient greek words ῥιπίς, ῥιπίδος (rhipís, rhipídos), meaning "fan", and οὐρά (ourá), meaning "animal tail".
