Lithobates brownorum is a species of frog native to southern Veracruz and northeastern Oaxaca east through the Yucatan Peninsula and the uplands of Chiapas in southern Mexico through Guatemala and Honduras to Nicaragua. Its separateness from Lithobates berlandieri has been questioned but molecular data now supports the conclusion that it is a separate species.
