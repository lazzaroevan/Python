Lithodryas is a prehistoric genus of butterfly in the family Lycaenidae. It was introduced as a replacement for Samuel Hubbard Scudder's genus Lithopsyche which is invalid as a homonym, as another fossil lepidopteran genus had been described under the same name shortly before Scudder established his genus.
The type species was found in Latest Eocene-aged deposits at Florissant.
