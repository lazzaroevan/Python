Sparicotyle chrysophrii is a species of monogenean, parasitic on the gills of the marine fish. It belongs to the family Microcotylidae. Its type-host is the gilt-head seabream (Sparus aurata).

The species was described by Van Beneden & Hesse in 1863 under the name Microcotyle chrysophrii  and transferred to the genus Sparicotyle (Figure 2-4) by Mamaev in 1984.
Its morphology has been described in 2010 from specimens collected off Corsica by Antonelli et al.It is ubiquitous and abundant in the aquatic environment, isolated from fish as ectoparasite on gill filaments. S. chrysophrii is specific but not limited to the gilt-head seabream (Sparus aurata), causing mortalities when contacted at high prevalence (61.5%) in fish cages. It has been suggested that wild fish, mostly sparids that aggregate around aquaculture fish cages, can act as the infection reservoir for the fish in cages.
As all monogeneans, it is hermaphroditic. Gravid specimens release eggs into the sea where they continue to develop and hatch into oncomiracidia â€“ free swimming ciliated larva that eventually finds and attaches to the host.An infection by S. chrysophrii causes lethargy due to the hypoxia and severe anaemia, with several histopatological effects: lamellar shortening, clubbing and synechiae, proliferation of the epithelial tissue with resulting fusion of the secondary lamellae, and marked presence of chloride cells.Economic impact encompasses direct losses from the mortalities and the cost of treatment. It has been suggested that the monogenean causes an increase by >0.4 of the total feed conversion rate (FCR) of the infected gilt-head seabream, which translates in an increased feed requirement for over 50,000 tons during the production (Rigos G., unpubl. data).
