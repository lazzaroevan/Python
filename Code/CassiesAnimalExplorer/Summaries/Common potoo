The common potoo, or poor-me-ones (Nyctibius griseus), is one of seven species within the genus Nyctibius. It is notable for its large yellow eyes and comically wide mouth. Potoos are nocturnal near passerines related to nightjars and frogmouths. They lack the characteristic bristles around the mouths of true nightjars. Until recently, the common potoo was said to range from Mexico down to the lowlands of central South America. However, in 2016, the species was subdivided into the northern potoo and the continuing branch of the common potoo, which only retains residence from Nicaragua to northern Argentina and Uruguay. This division was largely based on the differing calls of the two species (view 0:39-0:50 here). Though not yet classified as endangered, the common potoo has been declining in numbers due to habitat destruction.
