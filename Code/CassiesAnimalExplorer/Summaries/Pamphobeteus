Pamphobeteus is a genus of tarantulas that was first described by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1901. It includes some of the largest spiders in the world.
This genus was split from Lasiodora, distinguished by the lack of scopulae on the inferior side of the first leg femur and the differences in the organ for stridulation.
