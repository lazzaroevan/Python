Conus cedonulli is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
Being a very varied species-complex, there has been much confusion in the course of years about which species and subspecies to assign to the Conus cedonulli-complex, hence the number of synonyms named.  In 1985 D.L.N. Vink proposed assigning the following species to the Conus cedonulli-complex along with Conus cedonulli :
Conus aurantius Hwass in Bruguière, 1792
Conus insularis  Gmelin, 1791 : considered by Vink to be a synonym of Conus aurantius Hwass in Bruguière, 1792
Conus mappa  sensu Lightfoot, 1786
Conus sanctaemarthae spec. nov. : now synonym of Conus mappa sensu Lightfoot, 1786The following subspecies of Conus cedonulli were recognized by the World Register of Marine Species:

Conus cedonulli dominicanus Hwass in Bruguière, 1792: synonym of Conus dominicanus Hwass in Bruguière, 1792
Conus cedonulli insularis Gmelin, 1791: synonym of Conus cedonulli Linnaeus, 1767
