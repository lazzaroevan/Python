Dynamoterror is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now New Mexico during the Late Cretaceous Period, approximately 78 million years ago. The type species (and sole known species) is Dynamoterror dynastes. The generic name is derived from the Greek word dynamis (δύναμις) meaning "power" and the Latin word terror. The specific name is derived from δυνάστης, "ruler".
