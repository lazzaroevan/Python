The Lygaeoidea are a sizeable superfamily of true bugs, containing seed bugs and allies, in the order Hemiptera. There are about 16 families and more than 4,600 described species in Lygaeoidea, found worldwide. Most feed on seeds or sap, but a few are predators.The ash-gray leaf bug family (Piesmatidae), may be placed here, but some authorities place it in its own superorder Piesmatoidea Amyot & Serville, 1843, being closer to the Aradoidea.
