Spermophilus pallidicauda (pallid ground squirrel) is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is found in Mongolia and the adjacent Nei Mongol autonomous region.A generic revision of the genus was undertaken in 2007 which helped resolve the uncertainty as to whether this species should be considered a subspecies of Spermophilus erythrogenys. A phylogeny based on molecular sequence data determined that S. pallidicauda was indeed a separate species from S. erythrogenys, and from the other similar species in the genus, S. brevicauda and S. alashanicus.
