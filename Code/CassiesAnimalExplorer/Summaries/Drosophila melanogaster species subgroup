The Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup contains 9 species of flies, including the best known species Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. The subgroup belongs to the Drosophila melanogaster species group within the subgenus Sophophora. 
Males can discriminate between females of different species, in part, by detecting differences in the hydrocarbon pheromones coating their bodies. Females can discriminate between males of different species, in part, by detecting species-specific differences in the male's courtship behavior. When copulation does occur between different species, the hybrid progeny are often non-viable, sterile or fertile with lower fitness.
