Parachromis friedrichsthalii, the Yellowjacket cichlid, is a species of cichlid native to Central America where it is found along the Atlantic Slope in Mexico, Belize, Honduras and Guatemala.  This species grows to a length of 28 centimetres (11 in) SL.  This species is popular with anglers as a gamefish and can also be found in the aquarium trade. The specific name honours the Austrian explorer, botanist and archaeologist Emanuel von Friedrichsthal (1809-1842), who sent many specimens to Vienna from Central America, including the type of this fish.P. friedrichsthalii has an unusual hunting mechanism. The species has been observed to lie immobile near the bottom, feining death.  When smaller fish approach and attempt to pick at the dead fish, P. friedrichsthalii ambush the smaller fish. Similar behaviour has also been observed in some species of Lake Malawi cichlids, particularly from the genus Nimbochromis.
