Cortes salamander (Cryptotriton nasalis) is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is found in the Sierra de Omoa in northwestern Honduras and Sierra de Caral in eastern Guatemala, close to the border with Honduras. The vernacular name Cortes salamander refers to the Cort√©s Department where the type locality is located, whereas the alternative name Cortez' hidden salamander with the spelling "Cortez" and the apostrophe are errors.
