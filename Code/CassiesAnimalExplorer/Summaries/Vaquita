The vaquita (Phocoena sinus), literally "little cow", is a species of porpoise endemic to the northern end of the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez, Vermilion Sea). Averaging 150 cm (4.9 ft) (females) or 140 cm (4.6 ft) (males) in length, it is the smallest of all living cetaceans. Today, the species is on the brink of extinction.  The steep decline in abundance is primarily due to bycatch in gillnets from the illegal totoaba fishery.
