Parasitica (the parasitican wasps) is an obsolete, paraphyletic infraorder of Apocrita containing the parasitoid wasps. It includes all Apocrita except for the Aculeata. Parasitica has more members as a group than both the Symphyta and the Aculeata combined. Parasitica also contains groups of phytophagous hymenopterans such as the Cynipoidea (gall wasps).
