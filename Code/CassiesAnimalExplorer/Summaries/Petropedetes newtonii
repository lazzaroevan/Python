Petropedetes newtonii is a species of frog in the family Petropedetidae. It is found in the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea) and in coastal Cameroon. It has been confused with Petropedetes vulpiae and Petropedetes johnstoni, and also considered a synonym of the latter. Because the holotype of Petropedetes newtonii is lost, a neotype was designated in 2018. Common name Newton's water frog has been coined for it.
