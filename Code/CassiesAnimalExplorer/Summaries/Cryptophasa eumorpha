The wingspan is 25â€“48 mm. The forewings are slate-coloured with a black dot in the disc beyond one-third and two in the disc at three-fifths, placed transversely, the upper one almost obsolete. There is a row of black dots along the hind margin and apical one-third of the costa. The hindwings are pale greyish-fuscous with a series of black dots along the hindmargin. Between the dots, the hind margin is whitish.
