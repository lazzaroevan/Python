Photolyases (EC 4.1.99.3) are DNA repair enzymes that repair damage caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. These  enzymes require visible light (from the violet/blue end of the spectrum) both for their own activation and for the actual DNA repair.  The DNA repair mechanism involving photolyases is called photoreactivation. They mainly convert pyrimidine dimers into a normal pair of pyrimidine bases.
