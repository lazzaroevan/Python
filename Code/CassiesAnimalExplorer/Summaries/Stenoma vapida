Stenoma vapida is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1877. It is found in Brazil in the states of Pará and Amazonas.The wingspan is 20–24 mm. The forewings are pale greyish, sometimes faintly ochreous tinged and with the extreme costal edge whitish except near the extremities. The stigmata are blackish, the plical very obliquely beyond the first discal. There is a cloudy dark grey dot towards the costa rather beyond the first discal and a very obscure irregular cloudy grey shade, from beyond the middle of the costa to the middle of the dorsum, excurved beyond the cell. There is a cloudy waved grey line sometimes marked with dark fuscous dots from the costa at to the dorsum before the tornus, excurved in the disc, sinuate indented towards the costa and dorsum. A marginal series of blackish dots is found from one end of this to the other. The hindwings are dark grey.
