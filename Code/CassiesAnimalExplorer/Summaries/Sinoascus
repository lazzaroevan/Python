Sinoascus paillatus is an extinct species of stem-group ctenophore, known from the Maotianshan shales of Yunnan, China. It is dated to Cambrian Stage 3 and belongs to late Early Cambrian strata.
Fossil specimens are poorly preserved, providing little details, if any at all, about the anatomy of the comb rows.
