Collocalia is a genus of swifts, containing some of the smaller species termed "swiftlets". Formerly a catch-all genus for these, a number of its former members are now normally (though not by all authors) placed in Aerodramus.
The genus Collocalia was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1854. The name Collocalia combines the classical Greek words kolla meaning "glue" and kalia for "nest".The genus previously contained fewer species. Seven subspecies of the glossy swiftlet were promoted to species status based on a detailed analysis of the swiftlets in the genus Collocalia published in 2017.
