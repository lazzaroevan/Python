For the frog genus, see Atelopus.

Ateleopus is a genus of ray-finned fish in the jellynose family Ateleopodidae. It is the type genus of its family, and the order Ateleopodiformes. For some time, it was known as Podateles, because Ateleopus had been used to replace the frog genus name Atelopus, which was deemed to be a spelling error. This was mistaken, however, and the fish and frog genera reverted to their original names.
This genus occurs in the fossil record since the mid-Miocene.
