The shining parrots, Prosopeia, are a genus of parrots (family Psittaculidae).
The genus is endemic to the islands of Fiji, although one species, the maroon shining parrot, has been introduced to Tonga. The three species are also sometimes known as musk parrots.
The shining-parrots have long tails, a languid crow-like flight and very bright plumage.
