Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Black currant nematode, Chrysanthemum foliar nematode, Chrysanthemum leaf nematode, Chrysanthemum nematode, Chrysanthemum Foliar eelworm) is a plant pathogenic nematode.  It was first scientifically described in 1890 in England.  This nematode has a wide host range.  Among the most important species affected are Chrysanthemums and strawberries.  A. ritzemabosi is a migratory foliar feeding nematode.  It can feed both ectoparasitically and endoparasitically, with the later causing the most significant damage.  When adequate moisture is present, this nematode enters the leaves and feeds from inside the tissue.  Typical damage is characterized by necrotic zones between the veins of the leaves.  Its lifecycle is short; only ten days from egg to mature adult.  A single female can lay as many as 3,500 eggs.  This pest can be difficult to control.  Host plant resistance, hot water treatments, and predatory mites are recommended.
