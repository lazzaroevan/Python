Conus adamsonii, common name the rhododendron cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
The epithet adamsonii commemorates Robert Stephen Adamson.
