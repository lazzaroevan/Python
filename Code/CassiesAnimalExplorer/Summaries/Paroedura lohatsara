Paroedura lohatsara is a species of small-to-medium-sized geckos native to northern Madagascar where it is found on a single mountain range. These geckos are up to 6 cm (2.4 in) long and are brown with black speckling, the speckles sometimes combining into longitudinal bands. Juveniles have wide transverse bands of black and transition into the adult colouring as they grow. This gecko is mainly nocturnal and is found on the ground, on boulders and in the lowest branches of trees. Because of its limited range and the ongoing destruction of its forest habitat, this species is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is not currently protected under CITES. Some individuals are kept in captivity in the United States and may act as a genetic resource if the gecko becomes extinct in the wild.
