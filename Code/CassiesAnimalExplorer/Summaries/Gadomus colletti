Gadomus colletti is a species of rattail. This deep-water fish is found in the waters around Japan, the Philippines, and northern Taiwan.
This species grows to around 40 cm (15.7 in) in length. This is a very pale fish with darker fins and white jaws. The head, unlike in many deep-water species, has firm bones and the mouth is wide and terminal with bands of villiform (brushlike) teeth. A long, filamentous chin barbel and a wide gill opening are present.
