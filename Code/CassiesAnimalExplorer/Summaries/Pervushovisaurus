Pervushovisaurus is a genus of platypterygiine ichthyosaur from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian, ~100-94 Ma) of the Saratov region in western Russia and the Cambridge area of the UK. It was originally described as a subgenus of Platypterygius, but later work showed that it was distinct from the type species of Platypterygius, P. platydactylus, to be elevated to full generic rank.
The type species of Pervushovisaurus, P. bannovkensis, is known only from the holotype, SSU 104a/24, a partial skull. In 2016, an additional species of Platypterygius, P. campylodon, was also referred to Pervushovisaurus.
