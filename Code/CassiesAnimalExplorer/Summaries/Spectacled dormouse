The spectacled dormouse or namtap (Graphiurus ocularis) is a species of rodent in the family Gliridae, and one of four dormouse species endemic to South Africa.
It has a bushy, squirrel-like tail, a fairly short muzzle, small ears and soft fur.  Its face is marked with white and grey, with dark rings (spectacles) around its eyes. Its cheeks, underparts and the upper surfaces of its paws are white. Its tail is also usually tipped with white.
Its distribution is restricted to the Cederberg in western South Africa, and it is associated with rocky habitats, as well as trees and outbuildings. It is nocturnal and an agile climber. Its diet consists primarily of seeds, other plant material and invertebrates.
