Siquisiquesuchus (meaning "Siquisique crocodile" after the town in Lara, Venezuela, near where the first described specimens were found) is an extinct genus of gavialoid crocodilian. It is known from cranial remains and a few postcranial bones found in Miocene-age rocks of the Castillo Formation in northwestern Venezuela.
