The Malagasy giant chameleon or Oustalets's chameleon (Furcifer oustaleti) is a large species of chameleon which is endemic to Madagascar, but also has been introduced near Nairobi in Kenya (though its current status there is unclear). It occurs in a wide range of habitats, even among degraded vegetation within villages, but is relatively rare in the interior of primary forest.
