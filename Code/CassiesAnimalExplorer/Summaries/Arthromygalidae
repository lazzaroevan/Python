The Arthromygalidae are an extinct family of arachnids, possibly spiders. Fossils placed in the family were all found in the Carboniferous, 359 to 299 million years ago. They were considered by Alexander Petrunkevitch to be "mesotheles", i.e. placed in the spider suborder Mesothelae. Petrunkevitch used the family for Carboniferous fossils he regarded as mesotheles but which lacked eyes (those with eyes were placed in the Arthrolycosidae). Paul A. Selden has shown the fossil specimens only have "the general appearance of spiders", with segmented abdomens (opisthosomae), but no definite spinnerets.
