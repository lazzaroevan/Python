Lucilia bufonivora is a member of the fly family Calliphoridae which are commonly known as blow flies. L. bufonivora is commonly referred to as a toadfly. The adult flies will typically feed on pollen and nectar of flowers, while the larvae are parasitoids that feed mainly on the living flesh of the common toad (Bufo bufo), leading to the toad's death, though they have been found as parasites on other frog and toad species. It is common in north west Europe.
