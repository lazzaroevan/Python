Stephanopis altifrons is a crab spider found in Australia. A cryptic species often hidden on bark of a tree. The body length of the female is up to 10 mm, the male 6 mm. The colour is usually brown, or shades of grey, sometimes black. The egg sac is 7.5 mm in diameter. Often placed in a crevice in tree bark; irregular in shape and camouflaged with debris. Eggs are off white in colour, 25 to 30 in number. The female rests with the eggs. The food of this spider is appears to be other spiders. Recorded prey include spiders in the families Salticidae and Hersiliidae.According to Pickard-Cambridge, the single specimen used for the description of S. altifrons was dry-pinned. Therefore the specimen could not be properly examined, so it was not possible to determine if the specimen was adult. Moreover, he states his own sketch of the spider as “hasty”. This may explain why the somatic characters were inadequately described, genitalic features were not mentioned at all, and the illustrations were not detailed enough, making the species unidentifiable.
