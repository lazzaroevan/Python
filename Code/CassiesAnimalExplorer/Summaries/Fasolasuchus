Fasolasuchus is an extinct genus of rauisuchid. Fossils have been found in the Los Colorados Formation of the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni√≥n Basin in northwestern Argentina that date back to the Norian stage of the Late Triassic, making it one of the last rauisuchians to have existed before the order became extinct at the end of the Triassic.
