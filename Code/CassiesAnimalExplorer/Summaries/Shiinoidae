Shiinoidae is a family of parasitic copepods. The first species in the family to be described was Shiinoa occlusa, a single immature female of which was discovered on the fish Scomberomorus commerson, and described by Kabata in 1968. A second species, S. inauris, was found on Scomberomorus regalis and described by Roger Cressey in 1975, who also erected the family to hold the genus Shiinoa alone. A second genus was added in 1986, containing the single species Parashiinoa mackayi, which had been found on the fishes Pomadasys maculatus and P. argenteus. Nine species are now recognised in the two genera:
