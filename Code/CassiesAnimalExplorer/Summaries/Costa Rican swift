The Costa Rican swift (Chaetura fumosa) is a species of swift in the family Apodidae. It was split from the band-rumped swift, Chaetura spinacauda, in 1998.
It is found in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Panama with a natural habitat of subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
It is blackish and slim-winged with sharply contrasting pale-rump band and distinctly pale throat. It has a sooty black coloration is tinged with glossy blue. Its bill and feet are black in comparison to the band-rumped swift.
Costa Rican Swifts usually feed on insects in flight over open habitats and agricultural fields, although this species sometimes can be found over forest and semi-open habitats. It is usually found in groups of 5â€“10, but they form flocks of up to 50 after breeding season. It associates with other small swifts such as the gray-rumped swift, the band-rumped swift and the Vaux's swift where ranges overlap and where feeding is good. It nests in tree hole 30 ft. up in any sort of tree.
