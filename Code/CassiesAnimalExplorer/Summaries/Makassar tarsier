The Makassar tarsier (Tarsius fuscus) is a species of tarsier. Its range is in Indonesia in the southwestern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi,  near Makassar.  At one point the taxon was downgraded to a junior synonym of the spectral tarsier (T. tarsier). However, when that species' range was restricted to the population on a single island near Sulawesi, this nomen was resurrected to contain the remainder of that species.
