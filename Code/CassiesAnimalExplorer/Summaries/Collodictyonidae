Collodictyonidae (also Diphylleidae) is a group of aquatic, unicellular eukaryotic organisms with two to four terminal flagella. They feed by phagocytosis, ingesting other unicellular organisms like algae and bacteria. The most remarkable fact of this clade is its uncertain position in the tree of life. 
Recent molecular analyses place Collodictyonids (e.g. Collodictyon) in a clade also containing Rigifilida and Mantamonadidae. This clade has been name CRuMs and is sister to Amorphea.
