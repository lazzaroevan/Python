Macroglossum moecki is a moth of the  family Sphingidae. The type locality is ambiguous insofar as there are two groups of islands which have been referred to as the Schouten Islands. One group is off the north coast of Papua New Guinea, more or less opposite Wewak, while the second, which includes the islands of Biak, Japen and Numfoor, is in Geelvink Bay, Irian Jaya. Although the latter group is not now referred to as the Schouten Islands, it is the likely type locality for this species, given RÃ¼timeyer's reference to off NW New Guinea.
