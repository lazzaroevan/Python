Cyclops is one of the most common genera of freshwater copepods, comprising over 400 species.  Together with other similar-sized non-copepod fresh-water crustaceans, especially cladocera, they are commonly called water fleas.  The name Cyclops comes from the Cyclops of Greek mythology which shares the quality of having a single large eye, which may be either red or black in Cyclops.
