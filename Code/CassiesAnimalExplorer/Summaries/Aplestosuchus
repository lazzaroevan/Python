Aplestosuchus is an extinct genus of baurusuchid mesoeucrocodylian known from the Late Cretaceous Adamantina Formation of SÃ£o Paulo, southern Brazil. It contains a single species, Aplestosuchus sordidus. A. sordidus is represented by a single articulated and nearly complete skeleton, preserving the remains of an unidentified sphagesaurid crocodyliform in its abdominal cavity. The specimen represents direct evidence of predation between different taxa of crocodyliforms in the fossil record.
