Pseudomyrophis atlanticus is an eel in the family Ophichthidae (worm/snake eels). It was described by Jacques Blache in 1975. It is a marine, tropical eel which is known from the eastern Atlantic Ocean (from which its species epithet is derived), including Senegal and Angola. It dwells at a depth range of 40 to 100 metres (130 to 330 ft), and inhabits the continental shelf, where it forms burrows in sand and mud. Males can reach a maximum total length of 25.9 centimetres (10.2 in).
