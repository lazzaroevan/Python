Adults are on wing in May and again in August.The larvae feed on Populus alba, Populus angustifolia, Populus x canadensis, Populus candicans, Populus canescens, Populus deltoides, Populus nigra, Populus simonii, Populus suaveolens, Populus tremula and Populus trichocarpa. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a corridor. The first part of the mine is straight and narrow, and often follows a vein. The frass is concentrated in a nearly uninterrupted central line that does not occupy the full width of the gallery . The second part is considerably broader, sometimes almost resembling a blotch. The frass pattern here is very variable, ranging from a narrow central line to a broad band.
