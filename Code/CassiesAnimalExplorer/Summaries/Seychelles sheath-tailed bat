The Seychelles sheath-tailed bat (Coleura seychellensis) is a sac-winged bat found in the central granitic islands of the Seychelles. It is an insectivorous bat, feeding primarily in forest clearings at night and roosting in communal roosts by day. Although previously abundant across the island group, it now only occurs on three islands. Its numbers have been declining to such an extent that the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being critically endangered. Increases in the cultivation of coconut palms in plantations, and the introduction of alien plant species, seem to have reduced the availability of insect food.
