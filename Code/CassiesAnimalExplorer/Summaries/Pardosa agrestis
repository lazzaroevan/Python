Pardosa agrestis is a non-web-building spider in the family Lycosidae, commonly known as wolf spiders. 
Pardosa agrestis have brown bodies with longitudinal bands. Females are slightly larger ranging from 6-9 mm, while males range from 4.5 to 7 mm. They are hard to distinguish from their related taxonomic species. P. agrestis is the most abundant spider in central European agricultural habitats, preferring to inhabit open spaces. Its lifespan is around 1-2 years and its diet consists mainly of other arthropods, exhibiting non-sexually cannibalistic behavior at times. It has a long copulation duration that averages around two hours. The two mating seasons are June and August, producing 40-60 spiderlings per cocoon. Pardosa agrestis do not spin webs and are not venomous. They will chase after their pray and deliver bites using their chelicerae.
