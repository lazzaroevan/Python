Asiatosaurus (meaning "Asian lizard") was a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur which lived during the Early Cretaceous. Its fossils have been found in China and Mongolia. Its type species is known only from teeth, making it difficult to rely on information until more specimens are found to expand our knowledge. 
The type species, Asiatosaurus mongoliensis, was described by Osborn, in 1924. It was the first sauropod genus named from East-Asia. 
Asiatosaurus kwangshiensis, the second species, was described by Hou, Yeh and Zhao, in 1975 based on a tooth, three cervical vertebrae and multiple ribs from the Xinlong Formation of Guangxi, China. The genus was classified within Brachiosauridae by Hou et al.. Both are now classified as nomina dubia.
