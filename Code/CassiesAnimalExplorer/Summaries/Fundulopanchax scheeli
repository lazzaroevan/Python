The emerald aphyosemion (Fundulopanchax scheeli) is a species of killifish, endemic to the lower Cross River basin in Nigeria. It is a coastal rainforest fish which lives in small streams and ponds. It prefers a temperature of around 75 °F (24 °C), and a slightly acidic pH around 6–7. The specific name honours the Danish count, army colonel, explorer and ichthyologist Jørgen J. Scheel (1916–1989).
