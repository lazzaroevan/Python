Stictochila delosticta is a moth in the family Oecophoridae. It was described by Turner in 1946. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Victoria.The wingspan is 24â€“25 mm. The forewings are pale ochreous-grey with sharply distinct dark fuscous dots and scanty irroration. The first discal is found at one-fourth, the plical slightly beyond and there is a second discal at three-fifths, with a dot beneath the second. There are also a few dots towards the base, a very slender fuscous line from the mid-costa to four-fifths, bent beneath the costa and ending on the tornus, slightly rippled or divided into dots, as well as a terminal series of dots continued on the apical fourth of the costa. The hindwings are ochreous-whitish, towards the apex slightly greyish.
