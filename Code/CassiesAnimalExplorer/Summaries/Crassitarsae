Crassitarsae is a clade of avicularioid mygalomorph spiders first proposed by Robert J. Raven in 1985, based on a morphological cladistic analysis. Raven characterized the clade by a number of shared features, including the presence of some scopulae on the tarsi. The clade has been supported to some degree by subsequent molecular analyses, although with a somewhat different composition.
