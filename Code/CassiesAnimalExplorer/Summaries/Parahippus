Parahippus is an extinct equid, a relative of modern horses, asses and zebra. It was very similar to Miohippus, but slightly larger, at around 1 metre (10 hands) tall, at the withers.
Around 20 million years ago, during the Miocene epoch, some of Earth's environments were changing: forests and swamps were receding as more plains were developed. It is believed these developments affected many changes in the existing horse ancestors.
