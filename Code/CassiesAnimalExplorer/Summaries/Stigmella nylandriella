Stigmella nylandriella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in all of Europe (except the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula), east to Russia, where it has been recorded from Bryansk, Murmansk, Karelia, Leningrad and Voronezh.
The wingspan is 4â€“5 mm. The head is ferruginous yellowish to brown, collar whitish. Antennal eyecaps whitish. Forewings light shining ochreous-grey, apex somewhat darker. Hindwings pale grey. Adults are on wing in May and June.
The larvae feed on Sorbus aria, Sorbus aucuparia and Sorbus domestica. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long, gradually widening corridor that often closely follows the leaf margin for a long distance. At first, the frass is concentrated in a broad central line, but becomes coiled later.
