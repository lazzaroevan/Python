Coniomma is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It contains only one species, Coniomma hospes, and is endemic to the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The genus and species were first described by Julius Weise in 1922, and were re-described in 2011 by A. G. Moseyko. The genus is very closely related to Rhyparida.
C. hospes have conical eyes, and very long antennae that are longer than the body.
