Procoptodon is an extinct genus of giant short-faced kangaroos that lived in Australia during the Pleistocene Epoch. P. goliah, the largest known kangaroo species that ever existed, stood at about 2 m (6.6 ft). They weighed about 200–240 kg (440–530 lb). Other members of the genus are smaller, however; Procoptodon gilli is the smallest of all of the sthenurine kangaroos, standing approximately 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall.
