Perillus bioculatus, the two-spotted stink bug or double-eyed soldier bug, is a species of insect in the family Pentatomidae native to North America. Both the larval and adult stages are specialized predators of eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). However, the first instar larvae feed by sucking the juices out of potato stems.
