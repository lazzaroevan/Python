Conus cumingii, common name Cuming's cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.
This species is not to be confused with Conus cumingii Reeve, L.A., 1849, an invalid junior homonym and synonym of Conus virgatus Reeve, 1849 .
