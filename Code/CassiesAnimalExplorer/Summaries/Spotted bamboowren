The spotted bamboowren (Psilorhamphus guttatus) is a small species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae. It is monotypic within the genus Psilorhamphus. It is endemic to the Atlantic Forest, mainly at bamboo thickets, in southeastern Brazil and far northeastern Argentina. It is threatened by habitat loss. Despite its English name, this long-tailed brown and grey bird is not a wren, but an unusual tapaculo.
