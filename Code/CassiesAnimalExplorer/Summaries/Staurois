Staurois is a small genus of minuscule true frogs. Most species in the genus are restricted to Borneo, but two species are from the Philippines.  This genus is a quite ancient member of the true frog family, Ranidae. They are typically found in or near rapidly flowing, small rocky streams, and are sometimes known as splash frogs or foot-flagging frogs. The latter name refers to their unusual behavior of conspicuously waving their hindlegs and feet, as a way of signalling other members of the species. Similar behavior has also been documented in other frog genera, notably Hylodes and Micrixalus.
