Donodon is an extinct genus of mammal from the Early Cretaceous (?Berriasian) Ksar Metlili Formation of Talssint, Morocco. It differs from dryolestids in having upper molars that are not compressed mesiodistally. Recent studies suggest that it was closely related to various South American dryolestoids in the clade Meridiolestida. Specific similarities to Mesungulatum, a herbivorous mesungulatid, are noted.
