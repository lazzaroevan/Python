Artoriopsis is a genus of wolf spiders first described by Volker W. Framenau in 2007. They are endemic to Australia and are most diverse in the southern half of the continent, though A. anacardium is found in the tropical north of Australia. Their body size ranges from 3 to 11 mm, with males smaller than females. They appear to prefer open, vegetated or sandy areas of moderate humidity.
