In Turkey its distribution was observed in  the regions of Aegean, southern Anatolia (Antalya to Kahramanmara≈ü) and southeastern Anatolia.
Adults are on wing from April to October in one generation per year. In hot summers, adults diapause. Mating takes place before this diapause, but the eggs are laid after.
