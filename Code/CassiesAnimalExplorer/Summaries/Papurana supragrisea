Papurana supragrisea is a species of true frog, family Ranidae. It is endemic to New Guinea, including some nearby islands. It is known with certainty only from southeastern New Guinea and from the D'Entrecasteaux Islands. However, this name has been used more broadly for a species complex that is widely distributed in the mountains of New Guinea. Common name Papua gray frog has been coined for it.
