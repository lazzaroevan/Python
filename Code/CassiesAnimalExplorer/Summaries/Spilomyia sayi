Spilomyia sayi is a common species of North American hoverfly. It is a wasp mimic.
Adults are 12–16 millimetres (0.47–0.63 in) long and are seen from June to October in the northern part of their range. Males engage in hilltopping, where they find high ground to await females. Larvae are found in decaying heartwood of deciduous trees.
