The spotted berrypecker (Rhamphocharis crassirostris) is a species of bird in the berrypecker and longbill family Melanocharitidae. Although it is sometimes placed in the genus Melanocharis with the other berrypeckers in the family, it is now treated as distinct enough to merit a monotypic genus,  Rhamphocharis.
It is found in New Guinea.
Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.
