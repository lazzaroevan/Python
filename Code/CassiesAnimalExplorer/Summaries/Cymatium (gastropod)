Cymatium is a genus of small to large predatory sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Cymatiidae.This genus has numerous species, perhaps as many as 100, some of which have a worldwide distribution. The genus has been divided into at least 10 subgenera. Some authors have elevated those subgenera, giving them the full status of genera, but this is by no means universally accepted.
