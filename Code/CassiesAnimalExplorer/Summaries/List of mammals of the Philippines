This is a list of the mammal species recorded in the Philippines.
There are 210 native mammal species in the Philippines (excluding those of the order Cetacea, being whales, dolphins, and porpoises) of which around six are critically endangered, around thirteen are endangered, around thirty are vulnerable, and around two are near threatened. One former species, Acerodon lucifer, is extinct, but is now highly regarded as part of the species Acerodon jubatus today, thus, the species still thrives in the archipelago, but is extirpated on the island of Panay.
Seven species in the country have been introduced for agriculture, transportation, companionship, and tourism, amongst other reasons. Three species (introduced accidentally through ships) are worldwide pests: the black and brown rats, and the house mouse.
The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on 1) The Synopsis of Philippine Mammals by the Smithsonian Institution; 2) recent articles on species discovery in the country; 3) domesticated profiles; and 4) those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of May 21, 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, the Smithsonian Institution, or the University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature:

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of near threatened and least concern categories:
