Litophyton arboreum, also known as broccoli coral, is a common soft coral (octocoral) found from the Red Sea to the Western Pacific. It grows up to 80 cm, usually on seaward reef slopes or hard bottoms. The color of L. arboreum varies from pale olive-green to yellow or grey.  L. arboreum are anthozoans in the order Alcyonacea in the family Nephtheidae.  The L. arboreum was originally classified in 1775 by Peter Forssk√•l, a Swedish Linnaean naturalist.  As of 2016, the entire genus Litophyton was reclassified using phylogenetic data, in contrast to its original morphological classification.
