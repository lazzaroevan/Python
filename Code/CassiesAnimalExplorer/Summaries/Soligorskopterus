Soligorskopterus is a genus of eurypterid, a group of extinct aquatic arthropods. Fossils of Soligorskopterus have been discovered in deposits from the Late Devonian. The genus contains two species: S. tchepeliensis, the type species, from the Middle Famennian stage of Belarus, and S. shpinevi, from the Lower Frasnian stage of Russia. Its name derives from Soligorsk, the closest city from the fossil site of the type species, and the Greek word πτερόν (pteron), which means wing.
