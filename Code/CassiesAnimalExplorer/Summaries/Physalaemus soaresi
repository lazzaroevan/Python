Physalaemus soaresi is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae. It is endemic to southeastern Brazil where it is only known from three localities in the Rio de Janeiro state, one of them lost to urbanization and habitat degradation.The existing populations occur in secondary forest habitats, one of them very close to sea level, another one at 130 m (430 ft) above sea level. Both locations suffer from habitat loss, and the latter also from fire.The species lays its eggs in a foam nest on the surface of temporary pools.
