Muriwaimanu is an extinct genus of early penguin.
One species is known, Muriwaimanu tuatahi, which was originally referred to as Waimanu tuatahi. It was discovered in the Waipara Greensand near the Waipara River, in Canterbury, New Zealand, in 1980. The name Muriwaimanu comes from muri, Māori for "after", and Waimanu, referring to the fact that the fossils come from younger strata than Waimanu.
