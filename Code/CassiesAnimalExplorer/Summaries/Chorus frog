Pseudacris (commonly known as the chorus frogs) is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae found in  North America ranging from the Pacific coastline to the Atlantic.
The name of the genus comes from the Greek pseudes (false) and akris (locust), probably a reference to the repeated rasping trill of most chorus frogs, which is similar to that of the insect. 
It could also mean ‘false Acris’, distinguishing it from another frog genus.
