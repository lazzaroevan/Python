Conus tulipa, common name the tulip cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully.
A class of conopeptides named rho-TIA was discovered in Conus tulipa in 2001. This class of conopetides targets (react with) alpha1-adrenergic receptors.
