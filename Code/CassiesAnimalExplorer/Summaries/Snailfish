The Liparidae, commonly known as snailfish or sea snails, are a family of marine scorpaeniform fishes.
Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans, including the oceans in between, the snailfish family contains more than 30 genera and about 410 described species, but there are also many undescribed species. Snailfish species can be found in depths ranging from shallow surface waters to greater than 8,000 meters, and species of the Liparid family have been found in seven ocean trenches. They are closely related to the sculpins (family Cottidae) and lumpfish (family Cyclopteridae). In the past, snailfish were sometimes included within the latter family.
