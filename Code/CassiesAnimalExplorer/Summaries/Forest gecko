The forest gecko (Mokopirirakau granulatus) is a species of gecko.  Granulatus refers to the granular texture of the skin. Its Māori name is moko pirirākau ("lizard that clings to trees"). It is endemic to New Zealand, found in all areas except the Far North, Marlborough, and Canterbury.
In June 2010 seven forest geckos, four female and three male, were stolen from a wildlife park in Northland. Forest geckos are a protected species under the Wildlife Act 1953.
