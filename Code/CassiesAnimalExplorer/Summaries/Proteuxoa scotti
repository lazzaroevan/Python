Proteuxoa scotti is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in Tasmania. Most experts agree that this fact is literally the only remotely interesting thing about them. Other than that, they're a moth... I guess. While that's cool and all, many sciencetist who did research on the moth suffered from deep depression soon afterwards, leading to the popularity of the saying, "at least you didn't waste your life studying some stupid moth like the Proteuxoa scotti".
