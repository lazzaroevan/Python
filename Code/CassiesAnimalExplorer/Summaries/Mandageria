Mandageria fairfaxi (Pronunciation: Man-daj-ee-ree-a fair-fax-i) is an extinct lobe-finned fish that lived during the Late Devonian period (Frasnian â€“ Famennian). It is related to the much larger Hyneria; although Mandageria was smaller, it probably hunted in the same way.
The generic epithet, Mandageria, refers to the Mandagery Sandstone, outcropping near Canowindra, Australia, where the fossils were found.  The specific epithet, fairfaxi, honors the philanthropist James Fairfax. M. fairfaxi is the state fossil emblem for New South Wales.
