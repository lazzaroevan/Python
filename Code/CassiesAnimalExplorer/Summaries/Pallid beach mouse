The pallid beach mouse or Ponce de Leon beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus decoloratus) was known from two locations in Florida, Ponce Park, Volusia County and Bulow, Flagler County. No individuals have been seen since 1959. The average pallid beach mouse was 4 to 8 cm in length. This species burrowed into dunes for protection.
