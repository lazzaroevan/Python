Crangonyx floridanus is a species of amphipod. Crangonyx floridanus has a small head containing an anterior lobe, and medium-sized eyes. C. floridanus also contains two distinctive antennas, arranged in no particular order. One antenna is typically twice the size of the other, and contains an adornment flagellum. Its body is composed of a tightly packed interior and a smooth exterior, lined by coxal plates. Plates 1-4 are found rooted and lined with small hair-like bristles. These range in order from small or largeAmphipods belong to the arthropoda, a taxon containing many invasive species. Native amphipods are being out-competed by non-native amphipods because they reach carrying capacity quicker and have a higher growth rate. Crangonyx floridanus, also known as the Florida crangonyx, is a small omnivorous, freshwater amphipod. These freshwater amphipods originated from North America. They have a high invasion potential due to their high growth rate and wide ecological amplitude. Their growth rates have a substantial effect on local populations of the natural communities. Native populations may be reduced or eliminated completely by this invading species.
