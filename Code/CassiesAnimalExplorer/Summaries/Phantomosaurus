Phantomosaurus is an extinct genus of ichthyosaur, which existed during the late Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. It would have been around 6 metres long, with a skull of 50 cm.
Fossils of the species Phantomosaurus neubigi have been found in southern Germany. It was discovered and named in 1997 by Sander in the rocks of the Upper Muschelkalk.More recently, in 2005, the braincase was studied by Maisch and Matzke. They found it to be unique among all known ichthyosaurs in terms of braincase morphology. Despite its close relation to many other ichthyosaurs, in particular Cymbospondylus, Phantomosaurus appears to have a very primitive braincase which resembles other diapsids more than other ichthyosaurs.
