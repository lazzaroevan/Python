The bullnose ray (Myliobatis freminvillii) is an eagle ray, which is widely distributed in the western Atlantic. It is found at depth above 10 m (33 ft) in coastal waters from Cape Cod down to Argentina, but is absent from parts of the western central Atlantic. It reaches a maximum size of 106 cm (42 in) in disc width and gives birth to six young per litter. It is often confused with the southern eagle ray (M. goodei).
