The fringe-eared oryx (Oryx beisa callotis) is a subspecies of the East African oryx. It was originally described as a distinct species by Oldfield Thomas in 1892, but was subsequently re-evaluated as a subspecies by Richard Lydekker in 1912. Recently, analysis using the phylogenetic species concept has led some authors to conclude that it should be returned to full species status (Oryx callotis).
