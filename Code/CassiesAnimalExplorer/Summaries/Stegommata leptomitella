Stegommata leptomitella, the hakea leaf-miner is a species of moth in the Lyonetiidae family. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1880. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. It is also present in New Zealand, where it is an established adventive.The wingspan is about 8 mm. Adults are fawn.
The larvae feed on Hakea species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a straight corridor, filled with frass. Later, the mine is widened into a blotch with the frass deposited around the periphery. Pupation takes place outside of the mine in a flimsy white cocoon.
