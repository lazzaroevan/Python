Stereocyclops histrio is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is endemic to the northeastern Bahia state of Brazil where it occurs in remnants of the Atlantic forest. After the holotype was collected in 1944, the species went unrecorded until a population was found in the Una Biological Reserve and its surroundings in 1999. It is now known from four locations. Common name Bahia yellow frog has been coined for it, perhaps in reference to the bright lemon yellow coloration of the holotype. It was the only species in the genus Hyophryne until 2012 when molecular data demonstrated that it is nested within Stereocyclops species.
