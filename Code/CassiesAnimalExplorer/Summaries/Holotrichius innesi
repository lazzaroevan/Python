Holotrichius innesi (known as the afrur in part of its range) is an assassin bug found in some Middle Eastern countries. When touched, this insect emits a varying number of stridulating noises in double pulses.In the deserts of Israel the afrur ("dirt" in colloquial Hebrew, from its habit of covering itself with dirt) is believed to have a powerful venom, and that it is possibly to blame for deaths attributed to snake and scorpion envenomation. However, no deaths have been formally attributed to it.
