Cyprinodon nevadensis is a species of pupfish in the genus Cyprinodon.  The species is also known as the Amargosa pupfish, but that name may also refer to one subspecies, Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae.  All six subspecies are or were endemic to very isolated locations in the Mojave Desert of California and Nevada.
