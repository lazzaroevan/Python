Phrynobatrachus africanus (common name: African swamp frog) is a species of frog in the family Phrynobatrachidae. It is found in Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea (including Bioko), southwestern Central African Republic, western Republic of the Congo, and north-central Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its range might extend into Nigeria. The IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, however, considers the limits of its range unknown and does not include the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the range.
