Periclimenaeus is a genus of decapod crustaceans of the family Palaemonidae which is part of the infraorder Caridea. The genus was named by the English carcinologist  Lancelot Alexander Borradaile in 1915. He set out the distinguishing features of the genus as:

Body rather stout, cephalothorax deep, a good deal compressed, abdomen greatly curved Thorax without dorsal swelling. Rostrum rather short, compressed, toothed above only. Outer antennular flagellum not deeply cleft. Antennal scale of good breadth. Mandible without palp. Second maxilliped without podopalp. Third maxilliped narrow, with vestigial arthrobranch.
Pericimaenaeus robustus is known only from the type specimen which was collected off Amirante Islands by the Western Indian Ocean Expeditions of Prof. J. Stanley Gardiner and described in 1915 and again in 1917 by Borradaile, it was re-described by Dr A.J. "Sandy" Bruce of the Queensland Museum in 2005.
