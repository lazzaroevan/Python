Protoschinia was a genus of moths of the family Noctuidae.
Protoschinia scutosa, the only species in the genus was considered a synonym of Schinia nuchalis, but is now treated as a valid species. The genus was revalidated by Beck in 1996, but it is unclear if this is widely accepted since many authors still classify scutosa in the genus Schinia.
