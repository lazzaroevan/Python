Lulu's tody-flycatcher (Poecilotriccus luluae), also known as Johnson's tody-flycatcher, is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It was briefly known as Lulu's tody-tyrant, but following the death of Ned K. Johnson, one of the people responsible for the description of this species in 2001, the name was modified to Johnson's tody-tyrant by the SACC. Following the move of this species to the genus Poecilotriccus from Todirostrum, it was recommended modifying the name to tody-flycatcher. It is endemic to humid thickets, usually near bamboo, in the highlands of Amazonas and San Mart√≠n in northern Peru. It is threatened by habitat loss and is consequently considered endangered by BirdLife International and IUCN.
