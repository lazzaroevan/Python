Parakaryon myojinensis, also known as the Myojin parakaryote, is a highly unusual species of single-celled organism known from a single specimen, described in 2012. It has features of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but is apparently distinct from either group, making it unique among organisms so far discovered. It is the sole species in the genus Parakaryon.
