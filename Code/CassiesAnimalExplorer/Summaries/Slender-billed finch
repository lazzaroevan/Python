The slender-billed finch (Xenospingus concolor) is a species of bird in the tanager family Thraupidae. It is the only member of the genus Xenospingus.  
It is restricted to southwest Peru and northern Chile, and inhabits mainly riverine vegetation along coastal valleys. It has been considered endangered due to loss of habitat. Riparian thickets that were common are under pressure from logging by farm owners. Some information has indicated that it has adapted to threats by using olive tree plantations and other artificial habitats successfully.
