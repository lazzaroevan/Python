Free-living amoebae (or "FLA") in the Amoebozoa group are important causes of disease in humans and animals.
Naegleria fowleri is sometimes included in the group "free-living amoebae", and it causes a condition traditionally called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. However, Naegleria is now considered part of the Excavata, not the Amoebozoa, and is considered to be much more closely related to Leishmania and Trypanosoma.
