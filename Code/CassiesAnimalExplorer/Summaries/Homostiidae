Homostiidae is a family of flattened arthrodire placoderms from the Early to Middle Devonian.  Fossils appear in various strata in Europe, Russia, Morocco, Australia, Canada and Greenland.
All homostiids have flattened and elongated skulls.  According to Denison 1978, primitive homostiids have moderately long median dorsal plates, whereas in "advanced" homostiids, the median dorsal tends to be short and broad.Obruchev (1964) placed the following primitive genera Euleptaspis, Lophostracon and Luetkeichthys in a separate family, "Euleptaspididae," and Ã˜rvig (1969), claimed that the Euleptaspidids were totally unrelated to Homostiidae proper (i.e., being neither related to, nor ancestral), but, according to Denison, did not clearly explain his reasons why this was so.
