The curlfin sole (Pleuronichthys decurrens) is a flatfish of the family Pleuronectidae. It was first described to science by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert, his long-time mentee.
It is a demersal fish that lives on soft bottoms at depths of between 8 and 530 metres (26 and 1,739 ft). Its native habitat is the subtropical waters of the eastern Pacific, from Prince William Sound, Alaska in the north to San Quint√≠n, Baja California in the south. It can grow up to 37 centimetres (15 in) in length, and reach weights of up to 775 grams (1.709 lb), with females generally being larger than males.
