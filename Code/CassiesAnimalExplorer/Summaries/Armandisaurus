Armandisaurus explorator is an extinct species of iguanid that lived in what is now Santa Fe County, New Mexico, in the Early Middle Miocene period.  The fossil specimen is a well-preserved cranium with mandibles and parts of seven cervical vertebrae collected by J. C. Blick in 1940.  Fossil evidence suggests that A. explorator was a blunt, medium-sized iguana that grew to about 61 cm (24 in) including its tail.
