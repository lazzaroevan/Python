Philometra priacanthi is a species of parasitic nematode of fishes. Its name is derived from its host species, Priacanthus hamrur. It possesses dorsal lamella-like structures on the distal part of its gubernaculum, which can also be found on other of its cogenerates. The only species with a dorsal protuberance near the gubernaculum's end is P. priacanthi, however. P. lateolabracis can be distinguished from the former by the lateral caudal mounds separated dorsally, narrower lamella-like structures on its gubernaculum, shorter spicules, and by the testis extending anteriorly. Other gonad-infecting species differ from this one by possessing a smooth gubernaculum, and their spicules being of different lengths. Seven gonad-infecting species of Philometra can be distinguished from P. priacanthi by their host types, as well as by geographical distribution.
