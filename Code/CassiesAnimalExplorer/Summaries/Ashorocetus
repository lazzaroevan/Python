Ashorocetus is a monotypic genus of an extinct primitive baleen whale of the family Aetiocetidae.  It was named by Barnes et al. 1995, and contains one species, A. eguchii.  Fossils of this whale are found from the Chattian Morawan formation, near Ashoro, of upper Oligocene (28.4 to 23.03 million years ago) Hokkaido, Japan (43.3°N 143.8°E﻿ / 43.3; 143.8, paleocoordinates 44.6°N 141.4°E﻿ / 44.6; 141.4). Ashorocetus eguchii was described based on a partial skull and is named after the type locality and Kenichiro Eguchi of the Ashoro Museum of Paleontology.
