The forewings are pale greyish ochreous with three faint greyish transverse lines, the first curved, irregular, from just before the end of the costal fold to the dorsum at two-fifths, the second from a small brownish spot on the costa beyond the middle (the costal edge fuscous for some distance before this) gently curved beyond the cell but obsolete on the dorsal third, the third represented by a small semi-oval dark fuscous spot on the costa near the apex and a hardly curved series near the termen of seven indistinct grey dots on veins 1c to 7. The second discal stigma is small and grey. The hindwings are pale grey, becoming pale greyish ochreous towards the base.
