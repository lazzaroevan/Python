Corixidae is a family of aquatic insects in the order Hemiptera. They are found worldwide in virtually any freshwater habitat and a few species live in saline water. There are about 500 known species worldwide, in 33 genera, including the genus Sigara.
Members of the Corixidae are known in the United States as water boatmen, a term that is sometimes used in the United Kingdom for Notonecta glauca, an insect of a different family, Notonectidae, and Corixa punctata is the "lesser water boatman".
