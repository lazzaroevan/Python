Lithophane adipel is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by Foster Hendrickson Benjamin in 1936. It is found from the southeastern United States north to Canada, from the Maritime provinces and northeastern states west across the southern boreal forest zone to central Alberta. In Alberta it is only found in the Redwater sands. Some authors consider it a subspecies of Lithophane lepida.
The wingspan is about 42 mm.
