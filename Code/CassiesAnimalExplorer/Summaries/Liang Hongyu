Liang Hongyu (1102–1135) was a Chinese general of the Song Dynasty. She became famous during the Jin–Song wars against the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. Her real given name was lost in time. She was simply referenced in the official Chinese history books as "Lady Liang" (梁氏). "Hongyu" (红玉), meaning "Red Jade" in Chinese, was the name given in folk legends, Chinese operas, and novels after her heroic death in battle in 1135. She was the wife of Han Shizhong, a Song general known for resisting invaders from the Jin dynasty together with Yue Fei and others.
