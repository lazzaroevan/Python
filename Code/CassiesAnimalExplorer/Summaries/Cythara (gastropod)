Cythara is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Mangeliidae.This name is considered a nomen dubium. Hedley (1922: 260) and Powell (1966: 109) summarized the arguments against using the earlier name Cythara Schumacher, 1817, with much uncertainty regarding the identity of its type species, against Eucythara Fischer, 1883. The name has also been used by European authors (e.g. Knudsen, 1952; Nordsieck, 1977) for species classified now in Mangelia Risso, 1826.
