The Atherton scrubwren (Sericornis keri) is a bird species. Placed in the family Pardalotidae in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, this has met with opposition and indeed is now known to be wrong; they rather belong to the independent family Acanthizidae.
It is endemic to Queensland (south-eastern coasts of Cape York Peninsula). Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
