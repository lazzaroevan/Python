Homosaces pelochares is a moth in the family Cosmopterigidae. It is found on Java.
The wingspan is 14â€“15 mm. The forewings are pale ochreous, slightly and irregularly speckled fuscous, sometimes tinged yellowish-ferruginous posteriorly and on the veins generally. The costa is infuscated towards the base and the stigmata are cloudy and dark fuscous, the discal approximated and connected by a fuscous line, the plical indistinct, rather obliquely before the first discal. Sometimes, there is an angulated fascia of fuscous speckling towards the termen. There is an interrupted terminal streak or series of spots of darker fuscous speckling. The hindwings are grey.
The larvae feed on the leaves of Planchonia valida.
