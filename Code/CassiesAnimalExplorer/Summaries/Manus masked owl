The Manus masked owl (Tyto manusi) is a barn owl endemic to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. Some authors consider it a subspecies of Australian masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae).
It is a poorly known forest-dwelling species, which is rarely seen. Comparison with the closely related Australian masked owl indicates it is likely to have large territories, and the population may be smaller than 1000.
