The freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni or Crocodylus johnsoni; see below), also known as the Australian freshwater crocodile, Johnstone's crocodile or colloquially as freshie, is a species of crocodile endemic to the northern regions of Australia.
Unlike their much larger Australian relative, the saltwater crocodile, freshwater crocodiles are not known as man-eaters, although they will bite in self-defence, and brief non-fatal attacks have occurred, apparently the result of mistaken identity.
