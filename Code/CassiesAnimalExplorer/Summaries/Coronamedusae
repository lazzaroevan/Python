Coronamedusae is a subclass of jellyfish in the class Scyphozoa. It is the sister taxon of Discomedusae and contains about 50 named species, all included in the order Coronatae. Jellyfish in this subclass are either small medusae living in shallow marine environments, or large medusae living in the deep sea.The mouthparts of the members of this subclass are characterised by simple lips on a short manubrium as well as by robust marginal tentacles that arc away from the mouth. It is likely that these marginal tentacles are used to capture plankton, including crustaceans and small fish in the larger species.
