The shock-headed capuchin (Cebus cuscinus) is a species of gracile capuchin monkey from Bolivia and Peru.  It was previously classified as a subspecies of the Humboldt's white-fronted capuchin (C. albifrons), but in 2013 Mittermeier and Rylands elevated it to a separate species, following genetic studies by Boubli et al in 2012 and Lynch Alfaro et al in 2010.The shock-headed capuchin lives in lowland and seasonally inundated forests of the upper Amazon Basin, as well as montane forests of the western Andes Mountains up to elevations of 1,800 m (5,900 ft).   Males have a head and body length of about 40 cm (16 in) with a tail length of about 44 cm (17 in).  Females have a head and body length between 39 and 46 cm (15 and 18 in) with a tail length between 39 and 47.5 cm (15.4 and 18.7 in).
