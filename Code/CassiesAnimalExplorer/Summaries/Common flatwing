The common flatwing (Austroargiolestes icteromelas) is a very common species of damselfly of the subfamily Argiolestinae in the family Megapodagrionidae.  It is also known as an Australian flatwing.
Both male and female common flatwings look similar, with a long and slender body about 43 mm in length, and a bright metallic-blue colour. They usually rest with their wings flat open, but females sometimes rest with wings folded up. Their antennae are very small, and their compound eyes are comparatively large. Common flatwings do not use their legs for walking, but for capturing other flying insects in the air, like all other dragonflies and damselflies. They can be found along streams and creeks, are seldom found near still water ponds, but are more likely to be found near slow running water. This species likes to rest within a few metres of a creek or stream, in a shaded area, sometimes resting in large groups among plants. They perch on leaves and, when disturbed, fly a short distance. Common flatwings tolerate people close to them.
