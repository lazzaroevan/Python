The Cuban martin (Progne cryptoleuca) is a large swallow endemic to Cuba.
It is closely related to the Caribbean martin, P. dominicensis which breeds on Caribbean islands from Jamaica east to Tobago, and the P. sinaloae (Sinaloa martin) from Mexico.
It has at various times been considered alternatively as a race of the purple martin, Progne subis.
