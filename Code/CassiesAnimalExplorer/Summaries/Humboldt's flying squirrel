Humboldt's flying squirrel (Glaucomys oregonensis) is one of three species of the genus Glaucomys, the only flying squirrels found in North America.  Using genetic analyses, Arbogast et al. (2017) showed that Humboldt's flying squirrel, previously thought to be conspecific with the northern flying squirrel, was actually a distinct species. These squirrels do not actually fly but glide from tree to tree. Humboldt's flying squirrels are found in coniferous and mixed coniferous forests from southern British Columbia to southern California. They are similar in appearance to the northern flying squirrel, however, they are generally smaller and have darker pelage. They are good gliders but clumsy walkers on the ground. They feed on a variety of plant material as well as tree sap, fungi, insects, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings. They mostly breed once a year in a cavity lined with lichen or other soft material. Unlike most members of their family, flying squirrels are strictly nocturnal.
