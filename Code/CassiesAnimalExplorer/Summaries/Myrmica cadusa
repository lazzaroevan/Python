Myrmica cadusa is a species of ant. Myrmica cadusa differs from similar ants in the genus Myrmica by the external shape of the antennal socket, which is jar shaped. They forage on the ground surface. Myrmica are unique from other types of ants in many ways. These are their oval head, rounded clypeus, prominent frontal lobes and in most species, a strongly developed propodeal spine with two large nodes.
