Cydia illutana is a small moth of the family Tortricidae. It is found from western and central Europe (Great Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Germany and France), north to Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland) and east to Russia (Siberia).
The wingspan is 12â€“14 mm. Adults are on wing in May and June. There is one generation per year.
The caterpillars feed on the scales of conifer cones. Host plants are European silver fir (Abies alba), European larch (Larix decidua), Dahurian larch (L. gmelinii), Siberian larch (L. sibirica), Norway spruce (Picea abies), Siberian spruce (P. (a.) obovata) and common Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). They pupate in peat or rotting wood.The larval feeding activity disrupt the maturing of the cones and the ejection of the seeds of the host plant.
