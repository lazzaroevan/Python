Holophysis quadrimaculata is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Walsingham in 1910. It is found in Mexico (Tabasco).The wingspan is about 8 mm. The forewings are dark brownish fuscous, with four steel-grey costal streaks, all inclining a little outwards. The first, near the base, reaching over the fold and the second at one-fourth not reaching the fold. The third, median, reaching to the lower angle of the cell and scarcely separated from a diffused patch of the same colour before and beneath it. The fourth at three-fourths of the wing-length, shorter than the others, a line of steel-grey scales preceding the termen. The hindwings are greyish fuscous.
