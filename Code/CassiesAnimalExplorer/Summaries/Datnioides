Datnioides is a genus of fish known commonly as tigerfish, tiger perch or freshwater tripletails. It is the only genus in the family Datnioididae. These fish are found in fresh and brackish waters of rivers,  estuaries and coastal areas in South and Southeast Asia, and New Guinea.Some researchers suggest that this family is related to the tripletails, family Lobotidae, while others do not find enough evidence to make the suggestion. The two families share an apparently unique mode of tooth replacement, a trait which might be a synapomorphy.
