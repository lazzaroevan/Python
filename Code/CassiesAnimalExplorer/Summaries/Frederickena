Frederickena is a genus of passerine birds in the antbird family, Thamnophilidae. These are among the largest antbirds, and are native to the Guianas and Amazon Rainforest in South America. They are infrequently seen and generally found at very low densities.
The genus contains three species:
Black-throated antshrike, Frederickena viridis
Undulated antshrike, Frederickena unduliger
Fulvous antshrike, Frederickena fulvaThe fulvous antshrike was previously considered as a subspecies of the undulated antshrike but was promoted to species status based on a 2009 study of the vocalization.
