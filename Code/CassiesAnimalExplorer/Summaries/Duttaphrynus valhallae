Duttaphrynus valhallae is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to Weh Island, located northwest of Sumatra, Indonesia. Known only from the holotype (more correctly, syntypes), its ecology is unknown, but it is assumed to be a lowland forest species. Practically no forest habitat remains on Weh Island, and it is not known whether the species still persists there. Also its taxonomic validity is uncertain.
