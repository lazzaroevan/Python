Stegomosuchus is an extinct genus of small protosuchian crocodylomorph.  It is known from a single incomplete specimen discovered in the late 19th century in Lower Jurassic rocks of south-central Massachusetts, United States.  It was originally thought to be a species of Stegomus, an aetosaur (a type of armored herbivorous reptile), but was eventually shown to be related to Protosuchus and thus closer to the ancestry of crocodilians.  Stegomosuchus is also regarded as a candidate for the maker of at least some of the tracks named Batrachopus in the Connecticut River Valley.
