The forewings are white, irregularly and suffusedly sprinkled with dark brownish, sometimes forming cloudy spots or blotches attached to black markings. There is a black elongate mark on the costa towards the base, a spot at one-third and a larger one beyond the middle, as well as a black dot in the disc at one-fifth, and one towards the dorsum rather beyond it. There is a very oblique black dash in the disc before the middle and the second discal stigma is small, black, with a black dot towards the dorsum somewhat before this.
