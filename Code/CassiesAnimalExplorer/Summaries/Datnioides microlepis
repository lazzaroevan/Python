Datnioides microlepis, also known as the Indonesian tiger datnoid, Indo datmoid, Indonesian tigerfish, or finescale tigerfish, is a species of freshwater fish endemic to the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia (Sumatra and Kalimantan). Previous records from the Chao Phraya and Mekong rivers is due to confusion with the D. pulcher (Siamese tigerfish), which was included in D. microlepis until 1998. It reaches up to 45 cm (1 ft 6 in) in length. This fish is commonly seen in the aquarium trade, and often is seen when juvenile about 3–4 in (8–10 cm) long.
