The forewings are light reddish brown with a violet tinge, shaded with rich dark brown. At the base of the costa is a large dark brown area reaching down to the fold and from the basal third of the costa runs an oblique dark brown line across the wing to the apical third of the dorsum, edged basally with ochreous scales. At the end of the cell is a short, perpendicular, brown streak and the outer half of the costal area is dark brown.
