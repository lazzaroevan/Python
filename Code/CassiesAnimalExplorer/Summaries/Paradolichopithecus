Paradolichopithecus is an extinct genus of cercopithecine monkey once found throughout Eurasia. The type species, P. arvernensis, was a very large monkey, comparable in size to a mandrill. The genus was most closely related to macaques, sharing a very similar cranial morphology. The fossils attributed to Paradolichopithecus are known from the Early Pliocene to the Early Pleistocene of Europe (France, Spain, Greece, Romania, and possibly Serbia) and Asia (Tadjikistan and China). The East Asian fossil genus Procynocephalus is considered by some to represent a senior synonym of Paradolichopithecus.Paradolichopithecus was a terrestrial monkey generally believed to have developed a large body size as a response to predator pressure. Despite its close relation to macaques, it also shared a number of postcranial features with baboons. Its ankle joints also show a remarkable similarity with that of the hominid Australopithecus, and it has led to the idea that Paradolichopithecus may frequently have moved in a bipedal stance.
