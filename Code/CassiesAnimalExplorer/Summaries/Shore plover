The shore plover (Thinornis novaeseelandiae), also known as the shore dotterel or by its MƒÅori name of tuturuatu, is a small plover endemic to New Zealand. Once found all around the New Zealand coast, it is now restricted to a few offshore islands. It is one of the world's rarest shorebirds: the population is roughly 200.
