Atomotricha colligatella, the Olearia Skeletoniser, is a moth of the family Oecophoridae. It was described by Francis Walker in 1864. It is found in New Zealand.In 1897, Richard William Fereday noted that Edward Meyrick was not able to identify this species as being of New Zealand. George Hudson wrote in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand that he was "unacquainted with this species".Its larvae have been found feeding on various Olearia species, including O. solandri, O. fragrantissima and O. laxiflora; the larvae are  classified as Olearia specialists.In a 1917 paper, Meyrick tentatively listed its habitat as "North Island (?)". A study conducted at the end of the 20th century found A. colligatella larvae in Fiordland, Eastern Otago, and West Coast on New Zealand's South Island.
