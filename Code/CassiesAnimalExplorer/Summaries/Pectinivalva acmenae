Pectinivalva acmenae is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in New South Wales.
The wingspan is 4.5–5.5 mm for males and 5.2–5.6 mm for females. The thorax, tegulae and forewings are uniform shining dark grey with strong blue reflections. There is an inconspicuous tornal spot consisting of a few white scales. The hindwings are pale grey.

The larvae feed on Syzygium smithii. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a long, very narrow contorted gallery, filled with brown frass apart from irregular crenulations along the mine edge. The exit-hole is located on the underside and has the form of a semicircular hole. Pupation takes place in a reddish-brown cocoon.
