Spirurida is an order of spirurian nematodes. Like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. 
Some Spirurida, like the genus Gongylonema, can cause disease in humans. One such disease is a skin infection with Spirurida larvae, called "creeping disease". Some species are known as eyeworms and infect the orbital cavity of animal hosts.
