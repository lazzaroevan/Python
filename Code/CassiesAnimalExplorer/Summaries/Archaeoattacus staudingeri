Archaeoattacus staudingeri is a species of moth in the genus Archaeoattacus found on the Malay Peninsula and on Borneo.  The species is a deeper, more purplish brown than A. atlas, with a more angular forewing postmedial that is edged distad by grey patches in the spaces and concave distad anterior to the angle. The forewing apical markings are grey rather than pale brown or yellow.
Only two specimens have been taken in Borneo, both in lowland forest in Brunei.
