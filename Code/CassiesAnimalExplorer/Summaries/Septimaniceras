Septimaniceras is genus of ammonites that has probably evolved from Peronoceras and lived during the middle Toarcian stage of early Jurassic. Members of this genus existed from Bifrons Subzone to lower part of Variabilis Subzone. Their fossils were found in France, Hungary and probably also in Austria.
