Coleophora flaviella is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found from Germany to the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily and Greece and from France to Romania.
The larvae feed on Coronilla coronata and Coronilla minima. Young larvae live within a pod and feed on the seeds. Later, the larvae feed outside in a tubular silken case that is wrapped in a leaf fragment. The seeds are now consumed through a hole in the wall of the pod. At a later stage, the youth case is vacated and the larva makes a new, white, later brown, trivalved silken tube again wrapped in a single leaf fragment, only covering the tube partially. The mouth angle is about 10Â°. Larvae can be found up to June.
