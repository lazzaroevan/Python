A fancy mouse (fancy means 'hobby' in this context) is a domesticated form of the house mouse (Mus musculus), one of many mouse species, usually kept as a type of pocket pet. Fancy mice have also been specially bred for exhibiting, with shows being held internationally. A pet mouse is inexpensive compared to larger pets, and even many other pet rodents, but mice are comparatively short-lived: typically only 18 to 30 months.
