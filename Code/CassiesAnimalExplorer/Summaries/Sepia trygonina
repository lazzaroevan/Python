Sepia trygonina, the trident cuttlefish, is a species of cuttlefish in the genus Sepia from the Red Sea and the western Indian Ocean. Cuttlefish are a specific type of cephalopod that is a highly evolved branch of the Mollusca phylum. They are characterized by having a calcareous shell that is covered by a membrane with free fin lobes that are laterally placed on both sides of their head. They have a centered beak that is used for feeding which is surrounded by 10 appendages. The trident cuttlefish are carnivores that prey on fish, crustaceans, and shellfish. They are also a major source of food for larger marine life like dolphins, seals, and even birds.
