Musca sorbens, the bazaar fly or eye-seeking fly, is a close relative of, and very similar in appearance to, the housefly (Musca domestica). It is found in tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and the Pacific Ocean region. It breeds in excreta, especially human faeces, and is the main insect vector of trachoma, a major cause of blindness.
