Muraena argus, commonly known as the white-spotted moray, or the Argus moray, is a moray eel found in coral reefs from Mexico to Peru and around the Gal√°pagos Islands. It was described by Franz Steindachner in 1870, originally under the genus Gymnothorax. It dwells at a depth range of 18 to 60 metres (59 to 197 ft). Males can reach a maximum total length of 120 centimetres (47 in), but more commonly reach a TL of 60 centimetres (24 in).Due to its wide distribution, lack of known threats, and lack of observed population decline, the IUCN redlist currently lists M. argus as Least Concern.
