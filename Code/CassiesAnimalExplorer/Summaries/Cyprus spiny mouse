The Cyprus spiny mouse (Acomys nesiotes) is a little-known rodent endemic to Cyprus. These nocturnal animals are generally found in arid areas. After the last reliable record in 1980 no considerable effort has been made until 2007 when four individuals were rediscovered. Due to the insufficient data of its population the IUCN considers it as data deficient.
