Psenini is a tribe of aphid wasps in the family Crabronidae. There are about 11 genera and at least 460 described species in Psenini.
 In some recent phylogenetic analyses, this group together with the tribe Odontosphecini is considered to be the family Psenidae, treated as the sister lineage to the family Ammoplanidae and no longer included within Pemphredonidae, so as to keep families monophyletic.
