The common baskettail (Epitheca cynosura) is a dragonfly of the Corduliidae family.
The thorax is brown and hairy.  
Some specimens have a triangular spot at the base of the hindwing.
Individuals are difficult to distinguish from the other species in this genus.
The caudal appendages (structures at the tip of the abdomen) differ between the species and
can be compared with known drawings or close-up photos.
Their flight season can begin as early as January and extends to August.
They may also be seen October to December in north Florida.
