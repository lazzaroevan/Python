Phrynobatrachus pygmaeus is a species of frog in the family Phrynobatrachidae. It is endemic to the Central African Republic and is only known from its type locality, Bouala (originally spelled "Buala"), at 998 m (3,274 ft) above sea level on the Ouham River. Common name Chad river frog has been coined for this species. This name presumably reflects the earlier assumption that the type locality was in Chad, into which the Ouham River flows.
