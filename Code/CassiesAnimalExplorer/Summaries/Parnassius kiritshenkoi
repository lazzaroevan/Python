Parnassius kiritshenkoi is a high-altitude butterfly which is found only in the eastern Pamir Mountains.
It is a member of the snow Apollo genus Parnassius of the swallowtail family, Papilionidae. The species was first described by Andrey Avinoff in 1910.
For many years, P. kiritshenkoi was regarded as a subspecies of Parnassius staudingeri. It is however sympatric with P. staudingeri mustagata of the Sarykolsky Mountains and with P. staudingeri illustris of the Zaalaisky Mountains.
