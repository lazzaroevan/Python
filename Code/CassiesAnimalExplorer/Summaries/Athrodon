Athrodon is a genus of extinct pycnodontid that lived in shallow seas in what is now England and France from the Late Jurassic until the genus extinction during the start of the late Cretaceous.  The various species are very similar in splenial bone and tooth morphology to Mesodon.  Otherwise, no articulated or complete specimen is known: all fossils specimens are bone fragments and disarticulated teeth.
