Stigmella fasciata is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in Slovenia, Croatia, Greece and Turkey.
The wingspan is 4.3â€“5 mm. Adults are on wing from June to September.
The larvae feed on Quercus pubescens. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of an extremely densely wound corridor, resembling a brown dot. Only the last part of the corridor loosens itself from the knot.
