The Louisiana pine snake (Pituophis ruthveni) is a species of large, nonvenomous constrictor of the family Colubridae.  This powerful snake is notable because of its large eggs and small clutch sizes.  The Louisiana pine snake is indigenous to west-central Louisiana and East Texas, where it relies strongly on Baird's pocket gophers for its burrow system and as a food source.  The Louisiana pine snake is rarely seen in the wild, and is considered to be one of the rarest snakes in North America.  The demise of the species is due to its low fecundity coupled with the extensive loss of suitable habitat - the longleaf pine savannas in the Gulf coastal plain of the southeastern United States.  Management activities are being conducted to promote the species' recovery.
