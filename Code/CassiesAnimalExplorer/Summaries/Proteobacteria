Proteobacteria is a major phylum of Gram-negative bacteria. They include a wide variety of pathogenic genera, such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio, Helicobacter, Yersinia, Legionellales, and many others. Others are free-living (nonparasitic) and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation.
Carl Woese established this grouping in 1987, calling it informally the "purple bacteria and their relatives". Because of the great diversity of forms found in this group, it was named after Proteus, a Greek god of the sea capable of assuming many different shapes and is not named after the Proteobacteria genus Proteus.
