Darwin's Frog (Rhinoderma darwinii), also called the southern Darwin's frog, is a rhinodermatid frog native to the forest streams of Chile and Argentina. It was first described by the French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril and his assistant Gabriel Bibron in 1841, and is named after Charles Darwin, who had previously discovered it in Chile during his world voyage on HMS Beagle.The most striking feature of this frog is the tadpoles' development inside the vocal sac of the male.
