Perfect Imperfection: First third of progress (Polish: Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość. Pierwsza tercja progresu; also sometimes translated as "Ideal Imperfection") is a science fiction novel published in 2004 by the Polish science fiction writer Jacek Dukaj as the first part of a planned trilogy. It was published in Poland by Wydawnictwo Literackie. The novel received the prime Polish award for science-fiction literature, Janusz A. Zajdel Award, in 2004.
Dukaj himself wrote that he set out to write "a space opera to end all space operas", but for this he had to create a scientifically plausible and challenging universe, thus creating a hard science fiction novel.
