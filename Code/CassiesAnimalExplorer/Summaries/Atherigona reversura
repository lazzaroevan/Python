Atherigona reversura, the bermudagrass stem maggot, is a muscid shoot-fly. The genus comprises more than 220 species, and some of them are very damaging pests in agriculture.  The bermudagrass stem maggot takes its name from its host preference for bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis).
