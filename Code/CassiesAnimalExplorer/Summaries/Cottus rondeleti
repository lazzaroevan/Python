Cottus rondeleti is a species of freshwater cottid fish that is only found in the coastal HÃ©rault drainage of Southern France. The total known distribution comprises three distinct short stretches of stream, and the species considered critically endangered because of threat of drought that is promoted by water extraction and potentially by climate change.
The species is related to other European sculpins in the Cottus gobio complex (European bullheads), and was separated from them in 2005.
