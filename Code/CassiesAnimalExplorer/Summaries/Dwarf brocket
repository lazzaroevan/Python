The dwarf brocket (Mazama chunyi), or chunyi, is a small species of deer native to the Andean highlands in western Bolivia and southeastern Peru, where it is found in forest and p√°ramo. Its pelage is reddish-brown with dark grey foreparts and neck. The underparts are lighter brown, and the muzzle short and thick. It weighs around 11 kg.A little-studied species of brocket deer, the IUCN considers the dwarf brocket as Vulnerable. Research has occurred in the forests of Bolivia, expanding known localities and modelling geographic distribution; while as much as 40% of the habitat was degraded or fragmented, the rest showed good conservation. This led to the recommendation of treating it as Vulnerable.
