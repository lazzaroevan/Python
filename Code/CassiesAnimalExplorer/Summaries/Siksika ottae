Siksika ottae is an extinct prehistoric cartilaginous fish, lived during the Upper Mississippian. It has been discovered at the well known, Carboniferous-aged Bear Gulch Formation (Montana, United States). It is known primarily from fossil teeth, but also from partial neurocranium and mandibles which hint a close relationship to coeval petalodontiform sharks Janassa and Netsepoye. Dentition is generally heterodont.
Siksika means literally Blackfoot, being named after the Siksika Nation.
