The southern vole (Microtus levis) is a species of vole (rodent) in the family Cricetidae. 
It is found in Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Iran, Svalbard (accidentally introduced), North Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine and Norway. On Svalbard, they were first discovered in 1960 in the Grumantbyen area, and were thought to be the common vole until a genetic analysis correctly identified them in 1990.
