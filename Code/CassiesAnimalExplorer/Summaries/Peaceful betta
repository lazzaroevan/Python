The peaceful betta or crescent betta, Betta imbellis, is  native to Southeast Asia, where it occurs naturally in Southern Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and has been introduced to Singapore.  It is an inhabitant of stagnant waters in swamps, rice paddies, ditches, and pools.  This species grows to a length of 6 cm (2.4 in).  It is found in the aquarium trade.Betta imbellis have a pair of suprabranchial chambers that each house an air‐breathing organ known as the labyrinth apparatus:a complex bony structure lined with thin, highly vascularised respiratory epithelium. The labyrinth apparatus is a morpho‐physiological adaptation that allows the B. imbellis to extract oxygen from air. This adaptation allows these fish to persist in extreme conditions.
