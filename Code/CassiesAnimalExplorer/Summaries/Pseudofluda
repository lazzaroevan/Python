Pseudofluda is a genus of South American jumping spiders that was first described by Cândido Firmino de Mello-Leitão in 1928. As of August 2019 it contains only three species, found only in Brazil and Argentina: P. capandegui, P. pergeri, and P. pulcherrima. The name is a combination of the Ancient Greek "pseudo-" (ψευδής), meaning "false", and the salticid genus name Fluda.The male of this species is 2.5 millimetres (1⁄10 in) long. The cephalothorax is chestnut-colored to black, with a chestnut colored spot on the posterior region. A white line goes along the length of the cephalothorax. The back of the abdomen is tawny with violet and green metallic scales. The species was first found in Petropolis, Brazil.
