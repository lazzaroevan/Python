Liza is a genus of mullets from the family Mugilidae. Recent work has suggested that the genus is paraphyletic and its species should be placed in the resurrected genus Planiliza while others should be classified in the traditional genera Mugil and Chelon. Liza is derived from the Spanish word for a grey mullet.
