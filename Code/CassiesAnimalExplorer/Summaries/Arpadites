Arpadites is a genus of Ceratitids in the family Arpaditidae from the Middle and Upper Triassic (Ladinian and Carnian stages) of the Alps, Italy, Balkans, Himalayas, and Japan. (Arkel et al. 1962, L162)
Arpadites, named by Mojsisovics, 1879, is characterized by a compressed, evolute, discoidal shell with radial or faintly sigmoidal  ribs; smooth, continuous keels; umbilical tubercles, with or without lateral and ventrolateral tubercles as well; and ceratitic sutures with two lateral lobes (on either side). The genotype Arpadites arpadis came from the upper Middle Triassic (Ladinean) of the Alps in Europe. (ibid)
