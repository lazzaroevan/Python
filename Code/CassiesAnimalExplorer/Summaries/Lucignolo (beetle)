Lucignolo is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It was first erected in 2010 by Stefano Zoia. It contains only one species, Lucignolo capensis, originally described by Édouard Lefèvre in 1890. It is distributed in South Africa.The genus is named after Lucignolo (or "Candlewick"), a character from Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio. This name refers to the shiny, delicate body of L. capensis. The species was originally placed in Trichostola, but is now thought to be closely related to Odontionopa.
