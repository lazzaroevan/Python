Malawania is an extinct genus of basal thunnosaur ichthyosaur known from the middle Early Cretaceous (Hauterivian or Barremian stage) of Iraq. Malawania was named by Valentin Fischer, Robert M. Appleby, Darren Naish, Jeff Liston, Riding, J. B., Brindley, S. and Pascal Godefroit in 2013 and the type species is Malawania anachronus. It is unusual as it is much more primitive than other Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, being most closely related to Icthyosaurus itself from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, over 70 million years earlier, with all other known ichthyosaurs from the Late Jurassic onwards belonging to the family Ophthalmosauridae.
