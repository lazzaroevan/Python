Attack of the Mutant Penguins is a tower defense video game developed by Sunrise Games and originally published by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar first in Europe on December 20, 1995 and later in North America on December 29 of the same year.
When an evil race of aliens catches a glimpse of an animal tv show while monitoring broadcasts from Earth, they decide to disguise themselves as penguins to take over the world. As soon as their plan is revealed, two intergalactic beings are sent to defend the planet alongside the real penguins against the invasion. Attack of the Mutant Penguins was first showcased at the European Computer Trade Show, where attendees mistook it for a Jeff Minter title due to its off-beat style and is often compared with Lemmings in terms of its structure, in addition to having British humor. Initially an exclusive for the Jaguar, it was later ported by the same team and released by GameTek for MS-DOS in 1996 on Europe and later on other regions in 1997 under the title Mutant Penguins.
Attack of the Mutant Penguins received mixed reception from critics since its release. While it received praise for its graphics and originality, many were divided in regards to the gameplay and others criticized its learning curve. Critics also compared the game with both ToeJam & Earl and Sink or Swim due to its nature.
