Pelophryne brevipes is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to the Philippines and found on the islands of Mindanao and Basilan. Records from elsewhere in Southeast Asia (as in IUCN (2004)) refer to Pelophryne signata or possibly other species. Common names Southeast Asian toadlet and Zamboanga flathead toad have been coined for it.
