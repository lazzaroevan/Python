The dusky starfrontlet (Coeligena orina), also known as glittering  starfrontlet, is a hummingbird species in the subfamily Trochilinae.
It is found only at high altitudes in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia, and was first discovered on PÃ¡ramo de Frontino. Its status was mysterious for a long time as it was only known from a single museum specimen; and erroneously considered to be an immature golden-bellied starfrontlet Coeligena bonapartei. When it was rediscovered in 2004, in what is now the Colibri del Sol Bird Reserve, its status as a distinct species was confirmed.
Although this bird was listed as a species of Least Concern in the IUCN Red List for many years, it became evident that it was close to extinction, and its status was upgraded to Critically Endangered in the 2007 Red List issue, though downlisted back to Endangered in 2020.
