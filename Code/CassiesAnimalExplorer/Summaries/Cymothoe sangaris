Cymothoe sangaris, the blood-red glider, is a species of butterfly of the family Nymphalidae. It is found in Central Africa.
Some authors believe the species should be split into separate species. They base this on morphological characteristics (mainly in the females) and DNA research. The new species would be specialised in one food plant.Currently, the following subspecies are recognised:
