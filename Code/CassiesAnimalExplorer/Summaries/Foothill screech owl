The foothill screech owl (Megascops roraimae) is considered a distinct species by some authorities, including the International Ornithologists' Union. It is found in forests and dense second growth at altitudes of 200–1,800 metres (660–5,910 ft) in northern and western South America. Its taxonomy is extremely complex and a matter of dispute (see taxonomy).
