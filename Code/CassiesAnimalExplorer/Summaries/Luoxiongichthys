It is known from the holotype LPV-10144, which consists of nearly complete skeleton and skull, from the paratype LPV-10120, a partial skull and from the referred materials LPV-10625, LPV-6868 and LPV-11817. It was found in the new Middle Triassic Lagerst√§tte of the Guanling Formation, Member II. It was first named by Wen Wen, Qi-Yue Zhang, Chang-Yong Zhou, Jin-Yuan Huang, Zhong Qiang Chen and Michael J. Benton in 2011 and the type species is Luoxiongichthys hyperdorsalis. The generic name is derived from Luoxiong Town, where the specimens were found and ichthys, "fish" from Greek. The specific name comes from hyper, "over" and dorsalis, "of the back" from Greek in reference to its elevated "hump" in front of the dorsal fin.
