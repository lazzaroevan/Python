Cyclostomata  is a group of agnathans that comprises the living jawless fishes: the lampreys and hagfishes.  Both groups have jawless mouths with horny epidermal structures that function as teeth, and branchial arches that are internally positioned instead of external as in jawed fishes.  The name Cyclostomata means "round mouths". It was named by Joan Crockford Beattie.
