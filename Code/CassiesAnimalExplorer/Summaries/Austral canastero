The austral canastero (Asthenes anthoides) is a species of bird in the family Furnariidae, the ovenbirds.
It is found in southern Argentina and northern regions of Tierra del Fuego; the range extends northwestwards into southern Chile, as a migration region in the austral winter. In Chile it is mostly a non-breeding bird, except on the eastern border with Argentina, in the Andean cordillera where it is a resident breeder.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and temperate grassland.
The name "canastero" comes from Spanish and means "basket-maker", referring to the species' large, domed nests made of sticks or grass.
