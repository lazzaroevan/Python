Arenysaurini is a proposed tribe of primitive lambeosaurine hadrosaurs. It is composed of genera found in Europe and North Africa during the end of the Cretaceous period. European lambeosaurs were previously sorted into various lineages, but were found by Longrich et al. (2020) to form a singular monophyletic group. The tribe is defined as all hadrosaurids closer to Arenysaurus ardevoli than Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus, Parasaurolophus walkeri, or Lambeosaurus lambei. In addition to the various named genera, indeterminate remains from across the continent including the Basturs Poble bonebed were proposed to represent arenysaurs. A cladogram of Hadrosauridae, highlighting Arenysaurini, from that study is reproduced below:
