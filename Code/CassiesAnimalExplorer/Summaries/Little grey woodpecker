The little grey woodpecker (Dendropicos elachus), also known as the Sahelian woodpecker, is a species of bird in the family Picidae.  It is found in Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan. This species is described as somewhat rare, but it has a very large range and the population appears to be steady, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of "least concern".
