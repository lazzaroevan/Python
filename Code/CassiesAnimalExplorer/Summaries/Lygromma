Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. L. senoculatum, L. valencianum) and no eyes. The eyeless L. anops is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind L. gertschi is found only on Jamaica.
The Mexican genus Tivodrassus, and Tricongius have been suggested as sister groups of Lygromma.
Species reach a body length from about 2 to 4.6 mm.
