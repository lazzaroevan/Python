The crocodylian family Crocodylidae  includes the crocodiles, which are the members of the subfamily Crocodylinae, as well as potentially the false gharial, the only extant species of the subfamily Tomistominae. The latter is a subject of controversy as to whether it is a crocodile or actually belongs in the family Gavialidae. Further genetic analysis has to be done to come to a final conclusion.
