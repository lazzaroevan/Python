The Honduran emerald (Amazilia luciae) is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae.
This bird is found only in Honduras.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.
It is threatened by habitat loss, and deforestation. The species is locally common in arid thorn forest and scrub in the upper Rio Aguan valley, Department of Yoro. The Honduran Emerald is found in thorn forests near shrubs and cacti species because they are used for floral resources, feeding, and nesting. The species has also been observed to feed on vines, herbs, epiphytes, and parasites. Exploration of the less-accessible interior of Honduras has revealed a wider distribution than thought at the time of its "rediscovery," including frequent sightings in the Santa Barbara department. The species responds and joins mobs after hearing the calls of a ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum). It was described by George Newbold Lawrence in 1867.
