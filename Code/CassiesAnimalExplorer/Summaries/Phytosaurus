Phytosaurus is a dubious genus of phytosaur (an extinct group of superficially crocodile-like archosaurs), found in an outcrop of the Keuper (possibly the Exter Formation) located in Germany that was also the first phytosaur to be described, by George Jaeger in 1828. The name Phytosaurus means "plant lizard" (though it is now known to have been a carnivore), and the type species is Phytosaurus cylindricodon. The other known species is P. cubicodon.In 1826, the holotype was discovered in Wurtemberg, Germany. The remains consisted of parts of the skull and jaws, with the teeth preserved.
