The genus Corynorhinus consists of the big-eared bats, or American long-eared bats.  Only three species occur in the genus, all occurring in North America.  Members of this group were previously in the genus Plecotus, the long-eared bats, and were also then called lump-nosed bats.  Populations of these species are generally uncommon and declining.  Two subspecies, the Virginia big-eared bat (C. t. virginianus) and the Ozark big-eared bat (C. t. ingens) are federally endangered.
