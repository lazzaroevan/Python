The dusky rat (Rattus colletti) is a species of rodent in the family Muridae.
It is found only in the monsoonal subcoastal plains of the Northern Territory, Australia.
Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land call this animal Mulbu, a name applied to other rodent species.  It is eaten (Reverend Peterson Nganjmirra, personal comment in Goodfellow, Fauna of Kakadu and the Top End, 1993).
