Stenoterommata uruguai is a mygalomorph spider of Argentina, named after its type locality: Salto del Urugua√≠. This species is distinguished from other Stenoterommata (having anterior tarsi with reduced inferior tarsal claws) by its spermathecae consisting of a single dome bearing numerous receptacula. Its spermathecae are similar to those of S. quena, but in S. uruguai the basal dome is more rounded.
