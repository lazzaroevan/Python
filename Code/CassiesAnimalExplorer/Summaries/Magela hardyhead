The Magela hardyhead (Craterocephalus marianae) or Mariana's Hardyhead, is a species of fish in the family Atherinidae endemic to Australia.  It has a very restricted distribution, only found in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory where it inhabits shallow and fast-flowing freshwater creeks.  The fish has a high thermal tolerance, like some other species in the genus Craterocephalus, and may tolerate water temperatures up to 39.5ยบ. The specific name honours Walter Ivantsoff's daughter, Marian.
