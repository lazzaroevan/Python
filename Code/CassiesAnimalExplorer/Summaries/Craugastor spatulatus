Craugastor spatulatus is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to Mexico and known from Cuautlapam in central Veracruz and Vista Hermosa in the Sierra Ju√°rez, Oaxaca. Its natural habitat is cloud forest. This formerly abundant species has strongly declined because of habitat loss, although other factors may have been involved too.
