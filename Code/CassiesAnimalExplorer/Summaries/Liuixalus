Liuixalus is a small genus of rhacophorid frogs that are distributed in southern China (Hong Kong, Hainan, Guangxi). All species now in Liuixalus were originally placed in Philautus. There is no diagnostic morphological characters to define the genus. Instead, the genus was erected based on molecular genetic evidence showing distinctness of Liuixalus romeri (then known as Chiromantis romeri) from the rest of Chiromantis. The genus name commemorates Liu Chengzhao, a Chinese herpetologist.The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed two of the three species as endangered (Liuixalus ocellatus and L. romeri), while the remaining one is considered data deficient.
