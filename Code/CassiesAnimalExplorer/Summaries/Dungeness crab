The Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister  (the naming convention recognised by WoRMS) or Cancer magister (the naming convention recognised by ITIS), is a species of crab that inhabits eelgrass beds and water bottoms on the west coast of North America. It typically grows to 20 cm (7.9 in) across the carapace and is a popular seafood. Its common name comes from the port of Dungeness, Washington, United States, where it is "a prized crustacean that supports the most valuable fishery on the west coast", and where ocean acidification threatens the marine environment.
