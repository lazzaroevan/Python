Spatalistis rhopica is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae. It is found in India (Assam).The wingspan is 14â€“16 mm. The forewings are pale yellowish, finely strigulated with light ochreous and with about seven oblique transverse series of silvery-metallic dots. There are small discal tufts above the middle at one-fourth and halfway, sometimes tipped with dark ferruginous-fuscous. There often is a large deep ferruginous semi-ovate blotch extending along the dorsum from one-fourth to beyond the tornus, posteriorly reaching more than half across the wing and with an oblique projection inwards, but this blotch is sometimes wholly absent. The hindwings are whitish-fuscous or grey, posteriorly more or less suffused with brown or dark fuscous.
