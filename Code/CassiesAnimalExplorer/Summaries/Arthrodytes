Arthrodytes is an extinct genus of penguins which contains a single species, whose remains have been recovered from the San Julian Formation (Late Eocene to Early Oligocene) of Patagonia. Other authors report a younger age for the fossils recovered from the Early Miocene Gaiman and Monte Le√≥n Formations.Together with the related genus Paraptenodytes, they form the subfamily Paraptenodytinae, which is not ancestral to modern penguins.
