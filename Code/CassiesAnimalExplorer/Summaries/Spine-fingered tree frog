The spine-fingered tree frog (Charadrahyla trux) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae endemic to Mexico. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and rivers. As it is thought to be restricted to an area of less than 100 km2 and to be threatened by habitat loss and possibly chytridiomycosis, it is currently classified as endangered.
