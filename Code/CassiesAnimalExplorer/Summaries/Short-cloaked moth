The short-cloaked moth (Nola cucullatella) is a moth of the family Nolidae. It is distributed through most of Europe. It was collected in 2008 in the greater
Vancouver area of British Columbia (Westham Island). Vancouver is a major shipping port,
and is the most probable source area of the introduction
This is a small species (wingspan 15â€“20 mm) with grey or brown forewings with black basal areas which resemble a short cloak when the moth is at rest. The hindwings are uniform cream or grey. It flies at night in June and July [1] and is attracted to light.
The slightly hairy larva is reddish-brown with white marks along the back. It feeds on various rosaceous plants including apple, Cotoneaster, hawthorn, pear, Prunus, rowan and whitebeam. The species overwinters as a small larva.
