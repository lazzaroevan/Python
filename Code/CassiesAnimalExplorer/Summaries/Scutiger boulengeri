Scutiger boulengeri (common names: Boulenger's lazy toad, Boulenger's high altitude toad, Himalayan stream frog, and Xizang alpine toad) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is found in Nepal, India (Sikkim) and western China (Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Tibet). A healthy population has been found at an elevation of 5,270 m (17,290 ft) in one of the lakes in the Gurudongmar Lake complex in Sikkimese Himalaya. This is one of the highest elevations where amphibians have ever been recorded (Pleurodema marmoratum has been recorded higher at the Andes).
