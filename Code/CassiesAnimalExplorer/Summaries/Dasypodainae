The subfamily Dasypodainae (originally named "Dasypodidae") is a small subfamily of melittid bees, with more than 100 species in eight genera, found in Africa and the northern temperate zone, primarily in xeric habitats.
They are typically small to moderate-sized bees, with shaggy scopae, and are commonly oligolectic (e.g., Hesperapis regularis). All members of this family have two submarginal cells in the forewing.
