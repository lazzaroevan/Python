Arthrolycosidae is an extinct family of arachnids, possibly spiders. Fossils placed in the family were found in the Carboniferous to Permian, 359 to 252 million years ago. They were considered by Alexander Petrunkevitch to be "mesotheles", i.e. placed in the spider suborder Mesothelae. However, Paul A. Selden has stated they only have "the general appearance of spiders", with segmented abdomens (opisthosomae), but no definite spinnerets. At least some of the specimens placed in the family in the genus Arthrolycosa are considered to be spiders, whereas Eocteniza is "rather problematic as a spider".
