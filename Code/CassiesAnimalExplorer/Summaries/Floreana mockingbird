The Floreana mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus) or the Charles Island mockingbird, is a species of bird in the family Mimidae.
It is endemic to Floreana, one of the Gal√°pagos Islands; but human colonisation from 1832 onwards brought predators such as dogs and cats, and within 50 years the species was extinct on Floreana. It now occurs only on two inaccessible offshore islands, Champion and Gardner. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. The Floreana mockingbird is also known as Darwin's mockingbird, as it was the arguable inspiration for Charles Darwin's work on the origins of species; he noticed distinct differences between them and previous species he had encountered and consequently established the existence of other variants on neighbouring islands.Previously classified as an endangered species by the IUCN, recent research shows that its numbers are decreasing more and more rapidly, and it is on the brink of extinction. It was consequently uplisted to critically endangered status in 2008, though it was downloaded back to endangered in 2017.
