Profallotaspis is an extinct genus from a well-known class of fossil marine arthropods, the trilobites. It lived during the early Atdabanian stage, 526 million years ago. Profallotaspis jakutensis is arguably the earliest trilobite ever found. Representatives of Profallotaspis have been recorded in the provisional Cambrian Stage 3 deposits of Siberia and, probably, also North America.
