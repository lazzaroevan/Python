Pseudagrion australasiae is a species of damselfly in the family Coenagrionidae. It is found in India, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Thailand.It is a common damselfly, but usually under-recorded due to its similarity with other blue and black colored Pseudagrion species. Laidlaw described Pseudagrion bengalense as a new species, based on the comparison of his type in the Indian Museum with the mislabeled specimen of P. microcephalum as P. australasiae in British Museum. Lieftinck clarified the situation and placed P. bengalense as a synonym of P. australasiae.
