Sinibotys butleri is a snout moth in the subfamily Pyraustinae in the family Crambidae. It was described in the genus Crocidophora by Richard South in 1901 based on a single female imago collected in Ningbo in China's Zhejiang province. The species is sexually dimorphic, with females exhibiting shorter, less pointed forewings than the males. The imagines and genitalia of the species are illustrated in Lee et al. (2018).
