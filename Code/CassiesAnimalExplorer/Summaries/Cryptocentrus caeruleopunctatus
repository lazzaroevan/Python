Cryptocentrus caeruleopunctatus, commonly known as the harlequin prawn-goby, is a species of goby. It has recently begun colonizing the Mediterranean Sea as part of the Lessepsian Migration. Before its recording in the Mediterranean this species was restricted to the Red Sea where it occurs on open sand bottoms of clear water reefs living in association with alpheid shrimps.
