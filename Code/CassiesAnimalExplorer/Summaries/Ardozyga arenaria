Ardozyga arenaria is a species of moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Turner in 1933. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland.The wingspan is 17–18 mm (0.67–0.71 in). The forewings are brown or brown-whitish with the costa broadly and suffusedly whitish from the base to beyond the middle. The basal one-sixth of the costal edge is dark fuscous and there are fuscous costal dots at one-sixth, the middle, and four between this and the apex. The stigmata are fuscous, the first discal at one-third, the plical beyond it, the second discal at two-thirds, and a dot beneath it, both within a transverse whitish suffusion. There is a dot between and above the discals, as well as a narrow fuscous apical suffusion containing a series of pale marginal dots. The hindwings are whitish-ochreous, with the extreme apex pale fuscous.
