Fire-coloured beetles or otherwise known as eyelash bugs  are the beetles of the Pyrochroidae family, which includes the red cardinal beetles. Adults measure 4-20 mm; larvae reach 25 mm. Larvae of Pyrochroinae are found under moist bark of dead trees. They are probably mostly fungivorous, although they may become cannibalistic if too crowded.
This family contains some 150 species in 30 genera. The males of many species in the subfamily Pyrochroinae have comb- or antler-like antennae. This family also now includes most former members of the defunct family Pedilidae.
