The sleepy cod (Oxyeleotris lineolata) is a medium-sized fish in the family Butidae, native to tropical fresh waters of northern Australia and questionably from New Guinea.  It is a member of the order Perciformes, thus is unrelated to the true cods in the order Gadiformes.  Neither are they closely related to the Australian freshwater cods such as the Murray cod of the family Maccullochella.
They are one of the most favoured freshwater fish in Australia for eating, having white, flaky flesh, low fat content, and a mild flavour.
