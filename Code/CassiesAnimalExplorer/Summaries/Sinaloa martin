The Sinaloa martin (Progne sinaloae) is a species of bird in the family Hirundinidae.
This large and poorly-documented swallow is occasionally considered to be a subspecies of the Caribbean martin, Progne dominicensis.
It breeds semicolonially in sheer cliff faces within pine-oak forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Mexico, nesting in cavities. Presumed migrant records also come from Belize and Guatemala. It is assumed to winter in South America, however this is not known with certainty.
