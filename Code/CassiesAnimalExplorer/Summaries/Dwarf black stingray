The dwarf black stingray (Hemitrygon parvonigra) is a little-known species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found off northwestern Australia and perhaps throughout Southeast Asia at depths of 60–185 m (197–607 ft). Growing to a width of 51 cm (20 in), this species is characterized by an angular, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short row of spear-like thorns along the midline of the back and few dermal denticles elsewhere. Its tail bears a long fin fold along the bottom and a much shorter ridge along the top, both past the stinging spine. Plain brownish in color above, this ray can range from light to very dark. In some parts of its range, this species is occasionally caught incidentally by fisheries and sold for meat.
