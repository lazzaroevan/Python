Crossodactylodes pintoi (common name: brown bromeliad frog) is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae.
It is endemic to Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo states of southeastern Brazil, although the latter records may represent another species. This little known species is assumed to be associated with bromeliads, similarly as other Crossodactylodes species. It is probably impacted by habitat loss, including that caused by collecting of bromeliads.
