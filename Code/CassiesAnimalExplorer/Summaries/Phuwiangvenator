Phuwiangvenator ("hunter of Phu Wiang") is a genus of megaraptoran theropod that lived during the Early Cretaceous period in what is now Thailand. It contains a single species, P. yaemniyomi, recovered from the Sao Khua Formation. The holotype was first found in 1993, before being named in 2019. The holotype specimen consists of a partial skeleton consisting of a dorsal vertebra, three fused sacral vertebrae, right metacarpal II, right manual phalanges and unguals, right and left tibiae, left astragalocalcaneum, left metatarsal I, right metatarsals IIâ€“IV, right pedal phalanges and unguals, with a referred specimen including an atlantal intercentrum and right astragalocalcaneum which were found together. In the phylogenetic analyses it was found to be the basalmost megaraptoran.
