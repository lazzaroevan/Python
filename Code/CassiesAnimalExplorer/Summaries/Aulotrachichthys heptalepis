Aulotrachichthys heptalepis, also known as the Hawaiian luminous roughy, is a slimehead found in the Hawaiian Islands south of Niihau, the westernmost island. It has a depth range of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 ft). Males can reach a maximum length of 6.7 centimetres (2.6 in) TL while females can reach 5.1 centimetres (2.0 in) SL. It was first described in 1984 after 33 individuals were caught by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service in a series of cruises of the Hawaiian Islands.
