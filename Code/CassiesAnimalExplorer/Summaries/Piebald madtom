The piebald madtom (Noturus gladiator) is a species of madtom catfish that is found in seven river systems in the Tennessee and Mississippi coastal tributaries.  The most common systems N. gladiator is found in are, the Hatchie River, Obion River, and Wolf River.  This species is very susceptible to environmental changes including flow regimes, siltation in nesting sites, and poor environmental quality.  The Noturus catfish reproduces from February to September and females reach sexual maturity in only one year.  Current management strategies for this recently discovered species haven't been completely developed yet, but could be comparative to the management of other madtom species.  Siltation in the southern portions of the rivers, inhabited by Noturus gladiator that comes from the northern aspects of the waterways is causing stress on the reproductive success due to nest suffocation.  There are records as close as twenty years ago showing the species inhabiting multiple other rivers around the areas it currently inhabits.  This could be a sign that the species is in a decline.  There should be population surveys done on the existing habitat and water quality surveys done in the inhabited areas as well as the uninhabited neighboring areas to see what the limiting pollutant might be in the water causing habitats to shrink. The area that this species inhabits needs to be managed in a way that could see a resurgence in gladiators numbers.
