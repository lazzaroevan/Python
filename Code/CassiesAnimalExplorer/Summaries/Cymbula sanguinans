Cymbula sanguinans, the giant pinkray limpet, is a species of giant limpet, a marine mollusc in the family Patellidae. It is native to the coast of South Africa. At one time thought to be a subspecies of Cymbula miniata, molecular analysis has shown C. sanguinans warrants being treated as a full species, despite there being no obvious morphological differences between the two. This makes difficult the task of deciding which of the previous research studies refer to C. sanguinans, and which refer to C. miniata.
