Doumea is a genus of loach catfishes native to Africa.
Species of Doumea have a rather large and tapered body, a pointed head, and a thin caudal peduncle. Thin bilateral osseous peaks are sometimes present on the back and the belly, and are the precursors series of osseous plates observed in the other kinds of Doumeinae. By the shape of the body, these fish are adapted to rapids.
