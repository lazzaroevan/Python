The speckled chachalaca (Ortalis guttata) is a species of bird in the family Cracidae. It is found in forests and woodlands in the western Amazon Basin. It has distinct white scaling/spotting on the lower neck and chest, but otherwise it resembles other chachalacas, it being vaguely pheasant-like (though far more arboreal and social), and with an overall brown plumage.
