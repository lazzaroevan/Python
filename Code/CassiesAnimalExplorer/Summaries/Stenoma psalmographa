Stenoma psalmographa is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931. It is found in Brazil.The wingspan is about 18 mm. The forewings are white mixed light grey, appearing whitish grey. The basal third of the costa is light yellowish grey, the rest of the costal edge white with six small dark fuscous marks. There are two fine distinct transverse fuscous lines, the first at one-third, straight and direct, the second from two-thirds of the costa very obliquely outwards, above the middle right-angled and running to the dorsum before the tornus. Six or seven irregular fuscous dots or marks are found in the disc between these and there is a fine interrupted fuscous terminal line. The hindwings are pale grey, darker suffused towards the apex and with a suffused grey spot on each end of the cell.
