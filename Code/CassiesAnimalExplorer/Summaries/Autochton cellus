Autochton cellus, the golden banded-skipper, is a North and Central American butterfly in the family Hesperiidae. There are two populations, one in the eastern United States and the other in the southwestern United States and Mexico.  The eastern population is rare and local and uses only one host plant, the thicket bean (Phaseolus polystachios).  The southwestern population is uncommon to common and uses more than one host plant (see host plant list). The golden banded-skipper is most active mid-morning and late afternoon.  Their flight is sluggish and low to the ground, compared to closely related species.
