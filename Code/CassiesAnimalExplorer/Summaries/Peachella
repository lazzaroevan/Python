Peachella is an extinct genus of trilobites, fossil marine arthropods, with species of average size (about 3.5 centimetres or 1.4 inches long). It lived during the Toyonian stage (Upper Olenellus-zone), 516 to 513 million years ago, in what is today the southwestern United States. It can easily be distinguished from other trilobites by its club-like genal spines.
