Argyrodes argentatus is a kleptoparasitic spider.
In Singapore, it is often seen in webs of Nephila antipodiana.
On Guam it can often be found hanging in webs of the much larger spider Argiope appensa: while A. appensa can reach a total length of about 7 cm, A. argentatus females reach only 3mm, and males 2mm at the most.
Like in rats, following copulation the male seals the female's epigyne with a mating plug, preventing the female from further mating.
