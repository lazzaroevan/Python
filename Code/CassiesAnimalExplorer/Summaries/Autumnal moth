The autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen in 1794. It is found throughout the Palearctic region and the Near East and has a much wider distribution than its two close relatives (see below). In SÃ¡pmi (Lapland), in some years the numerous autumnal moth larvae defoliate square miles of birch forests on mountains.
