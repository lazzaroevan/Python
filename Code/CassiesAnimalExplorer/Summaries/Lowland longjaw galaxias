The lowland longjaw galaxias (Galaxias cobitinis) is a galaxiid of the genus Galaxias, found only in the South Island of New Zealand, in the Kauru River, a tributary of the Kakanui River in north Otago, and in parts of the upper Waitaki catchment. It grows to a length of up to 7 cm.
Lowland longjaw galaxias are slender and elongate, having colouration consisting of spots and indistinct bands of various shades of brown and grey.  The single dorsal and anal fins are about two thirds of the way along the body.  Like all galaxiids it lacks scales and has a thick, leathery skin covered with mucus.  The lower jaw is forward of the upper.
