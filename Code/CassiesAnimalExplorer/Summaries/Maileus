Maileus is a monotypic genus of  jumping spiders containing the single species, Maileus fuscus. It was first described by G. Peckham & Elizabeth Peckham in 1907, and is only found on Borneo. It is closely related to the genus Microhasarius.M. fuscus is known only from a single female, which is about 6 millimetres (0.24 in) long. Although no published drawings exist, Zabka has drawn the genitalia, and Proszynski has drawn the genitalia of both sexes of what is probably a different species of Maileus. No study has been published on the genus since its first description.
