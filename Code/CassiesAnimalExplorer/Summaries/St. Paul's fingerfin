St. Paul's fingerfin, Nemadactylus monodactylus, is a species of morwong native to the waters around Île Saint-Paul and Île Amsterdam in the Indian Ocean.  It has also been reported from Tristan da Cunha, Vima Mount on the west coast of South Africa, and off Australia and New Zealand.
This species reaches a size of approximately 60 cm, and is benthopelagic, feeding on both bottom-dwelling and open-water organisms.  Like other species of morwongs, it is occasionally harvested by commercial fisheries, but the effects of this on the overall species population have been relatively little studied.
