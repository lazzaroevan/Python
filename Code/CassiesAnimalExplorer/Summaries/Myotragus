Myotragus (Neo-Latin, derived from the Greek: μῦς, τράγος and Βαλεαρίδες "Balearian mouse-goat"), also known as the Balearic Islands cave goat, is an extinct genus of the subfamily Caprinae which lived on the Balearic Islands of Mallorca and Menorca in the western Mediterranean until its extinction around 5,000 years ago. The fossil record of Myotragus on the Balearic Islands extends over 5 million years back to the early Pliocene on Mallorca, where it presumably arrived after the major sea level drop during the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Myotragus is represented by a sequence of six chronospecies representing a gradual change in morphology. M. balearicus is noted for a number of unusual morphological adaptions, including forward facing eyes suggestive of binocular vision. Early genetic research suggested that it was closely related to sheep of the genus Ovis, however more recent research has indicated that its closest living relative is the takin (Budorcas taxicolor). The final species Myotragus balearicus became extinct when humans arrived in the Balearic Islands around 3000 BC.
