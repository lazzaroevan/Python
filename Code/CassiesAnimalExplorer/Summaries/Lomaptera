Lomaptera are beetles from the subfamily Cetoniinae, tribe Schizorhinini. The genus was created by Gory & Percheron, in 1833. The type species of the genus is Cetonia papua Guérin-Méneville, 1830. These cetoniids have the tip of the scutellum invisible, which makes the difference with the genus Ischiopsopha.
The genus is spread throughout the whole Australian region.
