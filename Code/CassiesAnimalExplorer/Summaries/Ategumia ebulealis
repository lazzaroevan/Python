It is found in Central America, the Antilles, Florida and Georgia. It was thought to be introduced to Hawaii, but later research concluded it was actually Ategumia matutinalis which was released.
The wingspan is about 18 mm. Adults are on wing in January, from March to April and from June to December in Florida.The larvae feed on Heterotrichum umbellatum and Clidemia species, including C. hirta.
