Criocephalosaurus is an extinct genus of tapinocephalian therapsids which existed in Southern Africa. It was originally named Criocephalus, but the name was preoccupied by a beetle genus. There are two named species, C. vanderbyli and C. gunyankaensis: the range of the latter may have been farther north than that of C. vanderbyli. Boonstra (1963) considers this taxon the most specialized of the moschopines.
