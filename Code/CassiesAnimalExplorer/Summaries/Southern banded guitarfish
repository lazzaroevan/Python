The southern banded guitarfish (Zapteryx xyster), also known as the witch guitarfish, is a species of fish in the Rhinobatidae family found at reefs and other habitats from shallow water to a depth of 90 m (300 ft) in the tropical East Pacific. It ranges from Mazatlan, Mexico, to Colombia, but it likely also occurs off Ecuador and Peru. It is closely related to the more northernly distributed banded guitarfish (Z. exasperata).
