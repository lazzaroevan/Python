Craugastor monnichorum is a species of frog in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to the mountains of western Panama in the Chiriquí Province; the type locality is on the slope of Volcán Barú. The specific name monnichorum honors the Monniche family, owners of the property where the type series was collected. However, the common name coined for this species, Dunn's robber frog, refers instead to the scientist who described the species, Emmett Reid Dunn.
