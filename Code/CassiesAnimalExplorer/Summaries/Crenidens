Crenidens is a small genus of one or two species of seabream from the family Sparidae from the western Indian Ocean. It was previously regarded as monotypic, with the sole species being the Karenteen sea bream Crenidens crenidens but the little known Crenidens macracanthus was proposed as separate species in 2013, although it is known from only two specimens.
