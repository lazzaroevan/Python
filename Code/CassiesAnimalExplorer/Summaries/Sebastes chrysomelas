Sebastes chrysomelas, commonly known as the black-and-yellow rockfish, is a marine fish species of the family Sebastidae. It is found in rocky areas in the Pacific off California and Baja California. Although it is similar in appearance to the
China rockfish, it lacks the China's long yellow streak. Its distribution is also more to the south than the China.
