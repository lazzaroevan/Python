This species is found in the Western Atlantic from Massachusetts, USA and Bermuda to the West Indies and northern South America.Chaetodon capistratus is the type species of Chaetodon. If this genus is split up as some have proposed, it will retain its present name like its closest relatives, which include the banded butterflyfish (C. striatus) and the spot-finned butterflyfish (C. ocellatus).
