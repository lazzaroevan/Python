Protobranchia is a subclass of bivalve molluscs.  It contains the extant orders Nuculanida, Nuculida, and Solemyida.
These are deep water clams of a small and primitive order with a taxodont hinge (composed of many similar, small teeth), generally with a central ligament pit, large labial palps which are used in deposit feeding and the gills used only for respiration, the anterior and posterior adductor muscles are nearly equal in size, a foot which is divided sagittally and longitudinally with papillate margins.  The foot in Protobranchia clams is without a true byssus gland, although they frequently have a nonhomologous byssal gland in the heel.  The byssal gland in these clams does not produce threads as in Pteriomorphia.
