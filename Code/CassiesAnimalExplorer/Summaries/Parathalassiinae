Parathalassiinae is a subfamily of flies in the family Dolichopodidae. It is part of an expanded concept of the family, Dolichopodidae sensu lato, and forms a monophyletic group with Dolichopodidae sensu stricto. It was once placed provisionally in the subfamily Microphorinae as the tribe Parathalassiini.According to Germann et al. (2011), there is strong evidence for placing Parathalassiinae within Dolichopodidae sensu stricto.
