The common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), also called the southern or black-eared opossum or gamb√°, and sometimes called a possum, is a marsupial species living from the northeast of Mexico to Bolivia (reaching the coast of the South Pacific Ocean to the central coast of Peru), including Trinidad and Tobago, where it is called manicou. It prefers the woods, but can also live in fields and cities.
The common opossum is sometimes used by humans for food.
