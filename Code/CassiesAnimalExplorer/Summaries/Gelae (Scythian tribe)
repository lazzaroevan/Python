The Gelae (Ancient Greek: Γῆλαι, Γέλαι, or Γέλοι, Gélai or Géloi ), or Gelians, were a Scythian tribe mentioned by Strabo and other ancient writers as living on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, in what is now the Iranian province of Gilan.  The name of the province might possibly be derived from the Gelae.
