Aphodius is a genus of beetles in the family Scarabaeidae. In most species both the adults and larvae are coprophagous (dung feeding) although some species have herbivorous or saprophagous larvae. Aphodius species typically dominate dung beetle communities in north temperate ecosystems. Most species are functionally classified as endocoprids, also known as dwellers, because the larvae live and feed within the dung pat itself.
