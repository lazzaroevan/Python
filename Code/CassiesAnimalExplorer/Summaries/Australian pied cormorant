The Australian pied cormorant (Phalacrocorax varius), also known as the pied cormorant, pied shag, or great pied cormorant, is a medium-sized member of the cormorant family.  It is found around the coasts of Australasia.  In New Zealand, it is usually known either as the pied shag or by its Māori name of kāruhiruhi.  Older sources may refer to it as the "yellow-faced cormorant".
