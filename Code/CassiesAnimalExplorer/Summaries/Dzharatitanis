Dzharatitanis (meaning "Dzharakuduk titan") is a genus of rebbachisaurid sauropod from the Bissekty Formation in Uzbekistan, dating to the Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous. The genus contains a single species, Dzharatitanis kingi, named after Christopher King, who contributed to the Cretaceous geology of Asia. It is the first recorded rebbachisaurid from Asia and one of the youngest known rebbachisaurids. Its location may have resulted from the migration of rebbachisaurids from Europe during the early-mid Cretaceous. It is currently one of two known sauropods from the Bissekty Formation, alongside an indeterminate titanosaur.
