Arrhenophanes perspicilla is a species of moth in the family Arrhenophanidae. It occurs throughout much of the lowland Neotropical Region from the state of Veracruz in Mexico to Misiones in Argentina and Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil, including Suriname. It is absent from the West Indies.
The length of the forewings is 13–21 mm for males and 19–32 mm for females. In favorable habitats, adults of this species can be encountered throughout the year. In the lowlands of Costa Rica, for example, adults have been collected in every month of the year.
The larvae feed on Polyporus species, including Polyporus vulgaris.
