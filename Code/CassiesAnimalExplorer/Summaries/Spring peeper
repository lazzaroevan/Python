The spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) is a small chorus frog widespread throughout the eastern United States and Canada. They are so called because of their chirping call that marks the beginning of spring. There are currently two subspecies recognized although detailed genetic and behavioural analysis demonstrates they likely aren't biologically real:
The northern, P. c. crucifer, found all over the eastern United States and eastern Canada.
The southern, P. c. bartramiana. The southern is distinguished by a strong dark marking on its belly. P. c. bartramiana is found along the southern Gulf Coast from southeastern Texas to northern Florida and southern Georgia.
