Habronattus dossenus is a species of jumping spider in the family Salticidae. It is found in Mexico. They are most well known for their unique dynamic signals such as scraping, thumping, buzzing, and/or buzzing. It has been shown that there is a strong correlation between their seismic (vibration) signals and motion signals, suggesting that H. dossenus utilize inter-signal interactions to create integrative communication. These seismic signals can range from rapid phasic sounds that are less than 200 milliseconds long to long phrases lasting multiple seconds.
