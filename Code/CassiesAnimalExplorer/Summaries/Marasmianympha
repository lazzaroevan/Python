Marasmianympha is a genus of moths of the grass moth family (Crambidae) described by Eugene G. Munroe in 1991. Its single species, Marasmianympha eupselias, was described by Edward Meyrick in 1929. Among the grass moths, it belongs to subfamily Spilomelinae. It is endemic to the Marquesas Islands of Polynesia, where it has been recorded on Fatu Hiva, Hiva Oa and Tahuata, but is suspected to occur on other islands as well. The holotype specimen is in the Natural History Museum, London.When first described, this moth was assigned to the genus Aulacodes in subfamily Acentropinae (then known as Nymphulinae). But eventually it was determined that despite a superficial similarity, M. eupselias is not a member of the Acentropinae, and hence by grass moth standards not at all closely related to Aulacodes.
