Proechimys is a genus of South American spiny rats of the family Echimyidae. All species of the genus are terrestrial. In the lowland Neotropical forests, Proechimys rodents are often the most abundant non-volant mammals. They are recognizable by reason of their elongated heads and long rostra, large and erect ears, narrow and long hind feet, and tails always shorter than head-and-body lengths. The dorsal pelage comprises a mixture of expanded, varyingly stiffened spines (or aristiforms) — hence the vernacular name of spiny rats — and soft hairs (or setiforms).Proechimys is the most speciose genus of the rodent family Echimyidae, with 25 species recognized, followed by Phyllomys with 13 species, and Trinomys with 11 species.
