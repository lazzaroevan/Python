Fordillidae is an extinct family of early bivalves and one of two families in the extinct superfamily Fordilloidea.  The family is known from fossils of early to middle Cambrian age found in North America, Greenland, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia.  The family currently contains two genera, Fordilla and Pojetaia, each with up to three described species.  Due to the size and age of the fossil specimens, Fordillidae species are included as part of the Turkish Small shelly fauna.
