Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum or barred sorubim or barred catfish is a species of long-whiskered catfish native to the Suriname, Corantijn and Essequibo. The nocturnal predator feeds mainly on other fish and crabs. Females reach a more notable size. They become sexually mature at 56 cm (22 in), males at 45 cm (18 in) and this species reaches a maximum length of 90 cm (35 in) TL. Fecundity seems to be estimated at 8 million eggs per kg, but was recently measured in aquaculture at a lower, and more likely number of 150,000 eggs laid per kg.
