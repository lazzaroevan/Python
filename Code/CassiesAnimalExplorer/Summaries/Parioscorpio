Parioscorpio is an extinct genus of scorpion containing the species P. venator known from the Silurian aged Waukesha Biota of the Brandon Bridge Formation near Waukesha, Wisconsin.  It is currently the world's oldest and basalmost known scorpion, older than Dolichophonus from Scotland by several million years. The fossils were originally discovered in 1985 but were neglected for decades. It is known from two specimens which preserve parts of the pulmonary, cardiovascular and digestive systems.
