Austroplebeia australis (previously and originally known as Trigona australis) is a stingless bee species in the tribe Meliponini first validly described by Heinrich Friese in 1898.
Within Australia, they are occasionally referred to as bush bees.
The native range of A. australis extends more than 2,000 km, from the districts of Fitzroy and Central West Queensland, through the Darling Downs and into northern New South Wales, but is thought to be no further south than 31Â°04'S (Example: Hat Head National Park).
