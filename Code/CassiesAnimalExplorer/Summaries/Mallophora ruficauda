Mallophora ruficauda is a species of parasitic robber fly in the family Asilidae, endemic to South and Central America. Like other robber flies, M. rauficauda is known for its aggressive behavior and predation upon other insects, especially bees. M. ruficauda (like other members of the genus Mallophora) mimics a bumblebee to fool predators into thinking it has a painful sting and is not worth eating.M. ruficauda larvae parasitize scarab beetles and likely serve as an important biocontrol for the beetles, a pest species that eats the roots and tubers of plants while in the larval stage. On the other hand, adult M. ruficauda are apicultural pests because they feed on worker honeybees.
