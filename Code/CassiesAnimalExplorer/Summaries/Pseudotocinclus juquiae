Pseudotocinclus jusquiae is a species of armored catfish endemic to Brazil where it is known from a few localities of the Juquiá River basin. The type locality, a small creek in Juquitiba, is clear, with a slow current, mud, and in some places, sand on the bottom. Marginal vegetation includes a small area of pastures, small trees and shrubs. P. juquiae has also been found in the ribeirão Poço Grande, a tributary on the right margin of the Juquiá River; this locality, an old swamp area near the city of Juquiá, is heavily impacted by human activities, and is also used for garbage and sewage disposal.
