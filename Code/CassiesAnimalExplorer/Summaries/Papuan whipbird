The Papuan whipbird (Androphobus viridis) is a little-known and unobtrusive species of bird in the family Psophodidae. It is monotypic within the genus Androphobus. It is found in Western New Guinea.
It is currently classified as Data Deficient (DD) (reclassified in 1994 from Near Threatened), since very little is known about its population dynamics. This is probably due to the fact that it is very secretive, and, despite not being too restricted, thinly spread throughout its range; it is likely to be overlooked unless singing. It is apparently insectivorous.
