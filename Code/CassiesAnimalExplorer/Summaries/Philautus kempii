Philautus kempii (not to be confused with Philautus kempiae) is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. It is known with certainty from its type locality, Upper Rotung in Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India, in the area also claimed by China. It is also reported from Arunachal Pradesh in general as well as from extreme eastern Tibet; these might represent another species. Very little is known about this species, and even its taxonomic validity remains uncertain.
