Protungulatum donnae is the type species for the genus Protungulatum, an extinct early form of eutherian mammal. Though it is by no means the earliest mammal in the fossil record, a 2013 study considers P. donnae to be the oldest undisputed placental mammal fossil, though more recent examinations conclude that it was a more basal eutherian and that no placental predates the Paleocene.
