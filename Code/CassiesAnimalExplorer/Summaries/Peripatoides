Peripatoides is a genus of velvet worms in the Peripatopsidae family. These animals are nocturnal hunters that spit glue to trap their prey. In New Zealand species of Peripatoides have 14, 15 or 16 pairs of legs. Female Peripatoides produce eggs that are fertilized internally and babies develop inside their mother until large enough to be born, in batches of 4-6, as colourless miniatures of the parents.
