The genus Crambus includes around 155 species of moths in the family Crambidae, distributed globally. The adult stages are called crambid snout moths (a name shared with the rest of the family Crambidae, to distinguish them from Pyralidae snouth moths), while the larvae of Crambus and the related genus Herpetogramma are the sod webworms, which can damage grasses.
