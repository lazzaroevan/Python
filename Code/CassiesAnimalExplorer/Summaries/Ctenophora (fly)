Ctenophora is a genus of true crane flies.
The species are large (about 20 mm long, with 25-mm wingspans),  shiny black craneflies with large yellow, orange, or red markings to mimic wasps. Males have comb-like antennae.
The larvae are saproxylic. The species are confined to old deciduous forests, orchards, and other habitats with continuity of the presence of dying and fallen trees. Ctenophora species are important  bioindicators.
Ctenophora is distinguished from related genera (Dictenidia Brulle, Phoroctenia Coquillett) by these characteristic  combinations. The segments of the antennae of the males have two pairs of outgrowths, the lower pair longer than upper pair. The antennae of the female are distinctly 13-segmented, and often indistinctly serrated. The sides of the mesothorax bear long bristles. Sternite 8 of the  female is without dentate protuberances.
