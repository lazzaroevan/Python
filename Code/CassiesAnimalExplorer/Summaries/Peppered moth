The peppered moth (Biston betularia) is a temperate species of night-flying moth.  Peppered moth evolution is an example of population genetics and natural selection.The caterpillars of the peppered moth not only mimic the form but also the colour of a twig. Recent research indicates that the caterpillars can sense the twig's colour with their skin and match their body colour to the background to protect themselves from predators.
