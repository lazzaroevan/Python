It is found in the Indo-West Pacific region from the Andaman Sea and Sumatra east to Papua New Guinea, north to southern Japan, south to northwest Australia and the Great Barrier Reef. This species can be found in coastal habitats including the seaward side of reefs, drop offs and quite shallow waters with silty substrates. They are omnivorous, although sponges comprise the major part of their diet. They form pairs for breeding.
