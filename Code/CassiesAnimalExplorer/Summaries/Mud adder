The mud adder (Denisonia devisi ), also known as De Vis' banded snake, is a species of venomous snake in the family  Elapidae. The species is endemic to certain regions of eastern Australia, including South West Queensland, northern New South Wales and north-west Victoria. Its scientific and common names refer to Charles Walter De Vis (1829-1915), first director of the Queensland Museum and writer of around 50 papers on herpetology.
