Paracoeloglutus is a genus of flies from Chile in the family Dolichopodidae. It contains only one species, Paracoeloglutus chilensis. The generic name is a combination of the Greek word 'para' (meaning 'near') and Coeloglutus, a closely related genus. The specific name is derived from Chile, the country where P. chilensis was collected.
