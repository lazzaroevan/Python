The Mauritius kestrel (Falco punctatus) is a bird of prey from the family Falconidae endemic to the forests of Mauritius, where it is restricted to the southwestern plateau's forests, cliffs, and ravines. 
It is the most distinct of the Indian Ocean kestrels. It colonized its island home to evolve into a distinct species probably during the Gelasian (Late Pliocene).
It is the most distant living species among the western Indian Ocean kestrels (Groombridge et al. 2002, qv RÃ©union kestrel).
By 1974 the Mauritius kestrel was close to extinction, with only four known birds including one breeding female. After a number of conservation efforts, by 2019 there was a population of about 400 birds. This conservation achievement is regarded as one of the most successful and best documented bird restoration projects in the world.
