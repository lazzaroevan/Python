Pseudorhaphitoma granilirata is a small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.Kilburn had the strong impression that this species is a subjective senior synonym of Pseudorhaphitoma crudelis, except for the fact of the presence of 8 ribs in P. granilirata and 7 in P. crudelis.
