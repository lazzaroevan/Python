Atlantirivulus is a genus of fishes in the family Rivulidae. They are endemic to shallow swamps, creeks, streams and pools in the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil, ranging from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina. Several of the species are highly threatened, while others survive in well-protected reserves. A. janeiroensis was initially feared extinct, but has since been rediscovered in two reserves.Similar to closely related genera such as Anablepsoides, Cynodonichthys, Laimosemion and Melanorivulus, Atlantirivulus are non-annual killifish.They are small fish, no more than 6.5 cm (2.6 in) in total length. Compared to many species in the family, the colors of Atlantirivulus are relatively dull.
