Paranthrene insolita is a moth of the family Sesiidae. It is found in large parts of Europe, Turkey, Iraq, the Levant and the Palestinian Territories.
The larvae feed on Quercus species, Populus canadensis, Populus pyramidalis and possibly Salix alba. They bore in the thick branches of their host plant in the tree canopy. They create a brown parchment-like cocoon of loose texture covered with fairly coarse sawdust. Pupation takes place in a short tunnel.
