Macrosiphum rosae, the rose aphid, is a species of sap-sucking insect in the family Aphididae. It infests rosebushes as its main host in spring and early summer, congregating on the tips of shoots and around new buds. Later in the summer, winged forms move to other rose bushes, or to a limited number of secondary hosts, before returning to rosebushes to lay eggs in the autumn.
