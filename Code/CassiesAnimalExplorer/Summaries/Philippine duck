The Philippine duck (Anas luzonica) is a large dabbling duck of the genus Anas. Its native name is papan. It is endemic to the Philippines.  As few as 5,000 may remain. Overhunting and habitat loss have contributed to its decline.
It eats shrimp, fish, insects, and vegetation, and it frequents all types of wetlands.
