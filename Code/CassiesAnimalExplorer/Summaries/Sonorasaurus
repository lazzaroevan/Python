Sonorasaurus is a genus of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the Early to Late Cretaceous (Albian to Cenomanian stages, around 112 to 93 million years ago). It was a herbivorous sauropod whose fossils have been found in southern Arizona in the United States. Its name, which means "Sonora lizard", comes from the Sonoran Desert where its fossils were first found.  The type species is S. thompsoni, described by Ratkevich in 1998.
