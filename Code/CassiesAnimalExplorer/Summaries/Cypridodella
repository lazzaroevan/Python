Cypridodella is an extinct genus of conodonts.
The Alaunian, a sub-age also known as "Middle Norian", in the Upper Triassic, begins with the first appearance of the ammonites Drepanites rutherfordi and Cyrtopleuritis bicrenatus and with the conodont Cypridodella multidentata. The stage ends with the first appearance of the ammonites Gnomohalorites cordilleranus and Sagenites quinquepunctatus and the conodont Cypridodella bidentata.
