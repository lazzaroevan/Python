Paonias myops, the small-eyed sphinx, is a moth of the family Sphingidae. The species was first described by James Edward Smith in 1797. It is found from south-eastern Canada to Florida and westward almost to the Pacific Coast. It is also known from Mexico.

The wingspan is 52â€“69 mm. Adults are more nocturnal than most sphingids; after an initial bout of activity after dusk, they fly throughout the night. Adults are on wing from June to September in eastern Canada. In New Jersey, there are two generations per year and there are four generations in Louisiana.
