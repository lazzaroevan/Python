Asiatheriidae ("Asian opossums") is an family of Cretaceous metatherians in the order  Asiadelphia.  Different from the Ameridelphia, they lacked a prominent distolateral process on the scaphoid, and possessed a more slender fibula.  The masseteric fossa is deeper in this group than the true marsupials.
