A piaya (Hiligaynon: piyaya, pronounced [piˈjaja]; Spanish: piaya, pronounced [ˈpjaʝa]) is a muscovado-filled unleavened flatbread from the Philippines especially common in Negros Occidental where it is a popular delicacy. It is made by filling dough with a mixture of muscovado and glucose syrup. The filled dough is then flattened with a rolling pin, sprinkled with sesame seeds and baked on a griddle.
