The double-collared crescentchest (Melanopareia bitorquata) is a species of bird in the family Melanopareiidae. It is found in eastern Bolivia, where its natural habitat is dry savanna. Considered by some taxonomists to be a subspecies of the collared crescentchest, it has been split by others on the basis of a suite of consistent morphological differences.
