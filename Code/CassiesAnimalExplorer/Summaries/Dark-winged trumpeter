The dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis) is a species of bird in the family Psophiidae. It is found in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, but only south of the Amazon River and east of the Madeira River. The eastern range of dark-winged trumpeter extends into the lower adjacent Tocantins River drainage in the Brazilian state of Par치. As of 2012, this species is listed as a vulnerable species, with the easternmost subspecies obscura rare.
There are some differences in the colour of the back and chest in the subspecies, and it has been suggested that these should be treated as separate species: P. viridis between the Madeira and Tapaj칩s rivers, P. dextralis between the Tapaj칩s and Tocantins rivers, and P. obscura east of the Tocantins. The taxon dextralis can potentially be split further, with interjecta between Tocantins and Xingu, and "true" dextralis for the population between the Tapaj칩s and Xingu.
