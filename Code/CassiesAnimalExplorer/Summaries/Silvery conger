The silvery conger (Ariosoma anago) also known as the sea conger, the darkfin conger, the dark-finned conger-eel, or simply the conger eel, is an eel in the family Congridae (conger/garden eels). It was described by Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Hermann Schlegel in 1846, originally under the genus Conger. It is a tropical, marine eel which is known to dwell in sandy and muddy bottoms on coasts in the Indo-west Pacific. Males can reach a maximum total length of 60 centimetres.
The Silvery conger's diet consists primarily of benthic crustaceans and finfish.
