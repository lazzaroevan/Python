The collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus) is a small, slim bird of prey in the family Accipitridae  found in Australia, New Guinea and nearby smaller islands. As its name implies the collared sparrowhawk is a specialist in hunting small birds. It is characterised by its slight brow ridges and slender feet. The last segment of their middle toe projects beyond the claws of the other toes.
