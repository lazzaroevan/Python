Hume's white-eye (Zosterops auriventer) is a bird species in the family Zosteropidae. It is found in upland areas of Myanmar, southern Thailand, the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.
This species was formerly treated as a subspecies of the Indian white-eye (Zosterops palpebrosus). Based on a study published as two articles in 2017, it was promoted to species rank. Included as subspecies are two taxa that were previously treated as subspecies of Everett's white-eye (Zosterops everetti).There are four subspecies:
