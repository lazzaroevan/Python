Paragordius varius, also known as the nematomorphs or horsehair worm, are known to control their definitive host to jump into a pool of water, thus allowing the adult worm to escape and reproduce. They are similar to nematodes but are much longer and very thin (>4 inches longer and 1/80 to 1/10 inch in diameter). P. varius is usually found in water or wet areas. These worms definitive hosts consist of grasshoppers, crickets, cockroaches, and some beetles.
