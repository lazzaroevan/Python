The family Mycteridae is a small group of beetles with no vernacular common name, though recent authors have coined the name palm and flower beetles.
The family Mycteridae is distributed worldwide. There are about 30 genera and 160 species in three subfamilies Mycterinae, Hemipeplinae and Lacconotinae (=Eurypinae). These 3 subfamilies are extremely diverse in appearance and are sometimes difficult to have a present diagnosis of the adults at the family level. About 20 species are found in Australia, species of three genera are found in North America (Mycterus, Hemipeplus and Lacconotus)
