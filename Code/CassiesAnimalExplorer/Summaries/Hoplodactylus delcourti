Hoplodactylus delcourti, also commonly known as kawekaweau, Delcourt's sticky-toed gecko or Delcourt's giant gecko, is an extinct species of lizard, the largest known of all geckos, with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of 370 mm (14.6 in) and an overall length (including tail) of at least 600 mm (23.6 in). It was endemic to New Zealand, where it may have been called kawekaweau. The idea that Hoplodactylus delcourti is the kawekaweau of Maori tradition has been contested.
