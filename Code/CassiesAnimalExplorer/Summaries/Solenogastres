The Solenogastres (less often referred to as Neomeniomorpha), common name the solenogasters, are one subclass of small, worm-like, shell-less molluscs (Aplacophora), the other subclass being the Caudofoveata (Chaetodermomorpha).
Some recent literature, and recent molecular evidence, indicates that the Aplacophora may be polyphyletic, and therefore these taxonomists divide Solenogastres and Caudofoveata into separate classes.
