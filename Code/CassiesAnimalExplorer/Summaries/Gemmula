Gemmula, common name the gem turrids, is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Turridae, the turrids.These snails have been recorded as fossils from the Paleocene to the Quaternary (from 66.043 to 0.012 Ma). Fossils have been found all over the world.This genus is still regarded as paraphyletic and should be revised. A high number of undescribed species are estimated to belong to Gemmula. Since independent “Gemmula-like” lineages are distributed all over the turrid tree, a revision of Gemmula would entail again a complete revision of the family Turridae. 

They are venomous with disulfide-rich polypeptides in their venom ducts.
These bioactive peptides are likely to become a resource for novel pharmacologically active compounds
