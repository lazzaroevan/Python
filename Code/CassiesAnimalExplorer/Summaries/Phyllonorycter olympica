Phyllonorycter olympica is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from central Greece.
The larvae feed on Quercus coccifera. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They create a lower-surface tentiform mine with one strong fold. Most frass is located alongside the cocoon. The roof of the mine is completely eaten out.
