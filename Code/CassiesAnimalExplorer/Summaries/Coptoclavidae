Coptoclavidae is an extinct family of aquatic beetles in the suborder Adephaga. The Coptoclavidae lived from the Triassic to the Early Cretaceous. Coptoclavidae is a clade of Dytiscoidea. The increase in the teleost fish population and the competition of Gyrinidae and Dytiscidae is believed to have caused their extinction.
