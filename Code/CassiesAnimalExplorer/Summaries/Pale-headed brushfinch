The pale-headed brushfinch (Atlapetes pallidiceps) is a species of bird in the family Passerellidae. It is endemic to arid areas with low scrub at altitudes of 1,650–1,800 m (5,410–5,910 ft) in south-central Ecuador.
It is threatened by habitat loss and the nest-parasitic shiny cowbird. Most of its tiny known range, estimated at only 1 km2 by BirdLife International, is within the Yunguilla reserve, which, following the rediscovery of this species in 1998, was set up by the Jocotoco Foundation. Following intensive management, including the removal of cowbirds, the population of the pale-headed brushfinch is currently increasing. Further increase, however, may be limited by a lack of suitable habitat.
