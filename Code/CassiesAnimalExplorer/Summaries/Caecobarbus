Caecobarbus geertsi, the African blind barb or Congo blind barb (known as Nzonzi a mpofo in the local Kikongo language, meaning "blind barb"),  is a species of cyprinid fish. This threatened cavefish is only known from Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it is the only member of the monotypic genus Caecobarbus. George Albert Boulenger described this fish in 1921 and it apparently lacks any close relatives in the Congo region.Despite its common name, "African blind barb", other blind cave cyprinids are indigenous to Africa, notably the Somalian Barbopsis devecchi and Phreatichthys andruzzii.
