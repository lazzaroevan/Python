Promachus yesonicus, or shioya-abu (塩屋虻, シオヤアブ) in Japanese, is a species of robber flies. In Japanese, "shioya" means a salt merchant (someone who makes or deals in salt), and "abu" means a horse-fly. This insect is called "shioya-abu" because the males have a white tip to their tail that resembles salt.
