Pessopteryx is an extinct genus of ichthyosaur from the Early Triassic (Olenekian) of Svalbard, Norway. The genus and two species, P. nisseri and P. pinguis, were named in 1910 by Carl Wiman. Its synonyms are Omphalosaurus nisseri, Merriamosaurus (possibly a separate genus) and Rotundopteryx. The genus Pessopteryx was transferred to the genus Grippia in 1929 but Pessopteryx was later re-separated from Grippia.
