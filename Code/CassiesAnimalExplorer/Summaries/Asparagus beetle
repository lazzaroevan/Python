Crioceris, or asparagus beetle, is a genus of the family Chrysomelidae of beetles. The name is neo-Latin from Greek κριός, ram and κέρας, horn.
 Not all species in the genus Crioceris feed on asparagus (e.g., C. nigropicta). Some studies have found low genetic diversity among groups of isolated Chrysomelidae, and use Wolbachia species as a genetic marker.
