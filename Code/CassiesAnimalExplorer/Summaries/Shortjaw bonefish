Albula glossodonta (roundjaw bonefish, shortjaw bonefish, Indo-Pacific bonefish, sharpjaw bonefish, or smallmouth bonefish) is a type of marine fish found in the Pacific Ocean. They grow up to 70 cm. Shortjaw bonefish are important to food security throughout the coastal Pacific where they are native as Pacific island communities depend on this fish for food. However, the species has become depleted throughout much of its range.
