Stenoma picrantis is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1930. It is found in Par√°, Brazil.The wingspan is about 19 mm. The forewings are white, irregularly and suffusedly irrorated light grey, the dorsal half suffused light greyish ochreous. There are some dark fuscous scales indicating a short interrupted longitudinal streak from the base of the costa, and some along the fold anteriorly. A slender dark fuscous costal streak with the extreme costal edge whitish is found from one-sixth to two-thirds, slenderly interrupted at two-fifths, immediately beneath this some brownish suffusion forming irregular patches before and beyond the middle, the first with a spot of blackish irroration, some light yellow-ochreous suffusion beneath this, the second with two elongate blackish spots, the upper small. The plical and second discal stigmata are small and blackish. Beyond two-thirds is an elongate wedge-shaped blackish costal spot, from which a slender greyish line, rather acutely angulated in the middle and curved-sinuate below this, runs to the dorsum towards the tornus. There are also three black marks on the apical part of the costa, some grey suffusion beneath them. There is a terminal series of black dots. The hindwings are grey.
