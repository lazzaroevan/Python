The fire-eyed diucon (Xolmis pyrope) is a passerine bird of South America belonging to the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. It is usually placed with the monjitas in the genus Xolmis but was sometimes placed in its own genus Pyrope in the past.
It is 19â€“21 cm long. The upperparts are mainly plain grey. The underparts are pale grey with white throat and undertail-coverts. The eyes are bright coral-red, for which the bird is named.
It is found in central and southern Chile, southwestern Argentina, and Tierra del Fuego. Vagrant birds have occurred just eastwards of Tierra del Fuego in the Falkland Islands.
