Propleopus is an extinct genus of marsupials. Three species are known: P. chillagoensis from the Plio-Pleistocene, and P. oscillans and P. wellingtonensis from the Pleistocene. In contrast to most other kangaroos, and similar to their small extant relative, the musky rat-kangaroo, they were probably omnivorous.
The species assigned to this genus are:

Propleopus chillagoensis Archer et al., 1978
Propleopus oscillans (De Vis, 1888) (type species)
Propleopus wellingtonensis (Archer & Flannery, 1985)
