Coleophora paraptarmica is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in Afghanistan, Central Asia and Pakistan.
The larvae feed on Artemisia turanica. They create a leafy case, consisting of several leaf pieces, arranged very irregularly. The caudal end of the case is slightly down-curved, but is sometimes almost straight. The valve is two-sided. The length of the case is 5.5-6.5 mm and it is yellow or light chocolate-brown in color, although the caudal part is much darker and brownish. Larvae can found in the beginning of June and (after diapause) in May.
