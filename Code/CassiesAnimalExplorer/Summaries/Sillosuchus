Sillosuchus is a genus of shuvosaurid poposaurid archosaur that lived in South America during the Late Triassic period. Shuvosaurids were an unusual family of reptiles belonging to the group Poposauroidea; although their closest modern relatives are crocodilians, they were bipedal and lightly armored, with dinosaur-like hip and skull structures. Based on skull remains from members of the family such as Effigia, they were also toothless and likely beaked herbivores.
