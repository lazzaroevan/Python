Phelsuma lineata, the lined day gecko, is a species of diurnal gecko native to Madagascar. It has also been introduced to RÃ©union.This species as described appears to be a conglomeration of many distinct forms; three of these are currently recognized subspecies (ssp. lineata, ssp. bombetokensis, and ssp. punctulata), but others could be separate taxa that should be elevated to species status as was Phelsuma dorsivittata. Phelsuma lineata is not threatened, but some unknown subspecies might be.
