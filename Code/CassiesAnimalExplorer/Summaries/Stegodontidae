Stegodontidae is an extinct family of Stegodon-like proboscideans that was endemic to Africa and Asia from the Miocene (15.97 mya) to the Late Pleistocene, with some studies suggesting that some survived into the Holocene in China (until as recently as 4.1 thousand years ago), although this is disputed.
