The Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) is a rare deer native to the Middle East, today occurring only in Iran and Israel by being reintroduced into the wild. It has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008. After a captive breeding program, the population has rebounded from only a handful of deer in the 1960s to over a thousand individuals today.
