Paraisurus is an extremely rare extinct genus of mackerel sharks of uncertain affinities. It is sometimes placed in the family Cretoxyrhinidae. It lived in the Early Cretaceous, and is known in Europe, North America, and Asia. It is mostly known from isolated teeth, which have a distinct shape. They are mesio-distally compressed, with a large labial protuberance. An associated dentition is known from the Weno Formation of Texas, USA. Though originally presumed to go extinct towards the end of the Albian, an occurrence from the lower Atco formation implies survival into the early Coniacian.
