The freckled catshark (Scyliorhinus haeckelii) is a catshark of the family Scyliorhinidae. It is found on the continental shelf and upper slope from the western Atlantic from western Venezuela, Suriname, Brazil, and Uruguay, between latitudes 11° N and 32° S. However, specimens from the northern part of this range probably refer to other species.
