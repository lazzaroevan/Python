Cryptacanthodes giganteus, the Giant wrymouth, is a species of wrymouth found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea to northern California where it is believed to spend most of its life buried in soft areas at the bottom of the ocean at depths of from 6 to 128 metres (20 to 420 ft).  This fish can reach a length of 117 centimetres (46 in) TL. Like the wolf eel, giant wrymouths are easily mistaken for eels but are considered fish instead because of their lack of pectoral fins.
