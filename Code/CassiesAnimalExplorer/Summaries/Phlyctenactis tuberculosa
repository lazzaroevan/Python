It is native to shallow seas around Australia and New Zealand. It was first described by the French zoologist Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and the French naturalist Joseph Paul Gaimard. They were naval surgeons serving in the French Navy and made extensive collections of organisms they came across in their travels.
