Macroplata (meaning "big plate") is an extinct genus of Early Jurassic rhomaleosaurid plesiosaur which grew up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) in length. Like other plesiosaurs, Macroplata probably lived on a diet of fish, using its sharp needle-like teeth to catch prey. Its shoulder bones were fairly large, indicating a powerful forward stroke for fast swimming. Macroplata also had a relatively long neck, twice the length of the skull, in contrast to pliosaurs.A different species, Macroplata longirostris (previously called Plesiosaurus longirostris), which lived somewhat later, during the Toarcian stage, was also included in the genus; however, in 2011, Benson et al. reclassified it as a pliosaurid in the genus Hauffiosaurus, H. longirostris.
