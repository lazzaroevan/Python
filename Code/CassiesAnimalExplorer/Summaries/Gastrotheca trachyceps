Gastrotheca trachyceps is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae. It is endemic to the Cauca Department, Colombia, and is known from its type locality, Cerro Munchique in the Cordillera Occidental, and Vereda Santa Elena (Popay√°n) in the Cordillera Central. The specific name trachyceps is said to be derived from Greek trachy meaning "rough" and Latin ceps meaning head, in reference to the rough appearance of the head. The proper word in Latin for head is however caput. Common name Cerro Munchique marsupial frog has been coined for it.
