Fulvetta is a songbird genus. Originally proposed in 1877, it was recently reestablished for the typical fulvettas, which were long included with their presumed relatives in the Timaliidae (Old World babbler) genus Alcippe. But they are actually quite closely related to the family Paradoxornithidae.
It contains the following species:

Spectacled fulvetta, Fulvetta ruficapilla
Indochinese fulvetta, Fulvetta danisi
Chinese fulvetta, Fulvetta striaticollis
White-browed fulvetta, Fulvetta vinipectus
Grey-hooded fulvetta, Fulvetta cinereiceps
Taiwan fulvetta, Fulvetta formosana
Manipur fulvetta, Fulvetta manipurensis
