Aptenodytes ridgeni, also referred to as Ridgen's penguin, is an extinct species of penguin from the Pliocene of New Zealand. It was intermediate in size between its living congeners, standing an estimated 90â€“100 cm tall. The remains were first found in 1968 on a Canterbury region beach by 11-year-old schoolboy Alan Ridgen.
