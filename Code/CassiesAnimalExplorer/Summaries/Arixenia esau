Arixenia esau is a species of earwig, one of three species in the genus Arixenia.
This species was initially believed to be parasitic on bats, including the hairless bat (Cheiromeles torquatus), but is actually not a parasite. It is viviparous, giving birth to live offspring that develop in a uterus.
