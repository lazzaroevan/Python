Stenodus leucichthys is a species of freshwater whitefish in the family Salmonidae. In the strict sense its natural distribution is restricted to the Caspian Sea basin, and it is known as beloribitsa (literally meaning "the fish that is white" in Russian). The beloribitsa is now considered extinct in the wild, but  survives in cultured stocks.
