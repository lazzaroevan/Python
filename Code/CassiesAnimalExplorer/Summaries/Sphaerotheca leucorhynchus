Sphaerotheca leucorhynchus (common names: Wattakole bullfrog, Rao's burrowing frog, Rao's white-banded frog) is a species of frog in the family Dicroglossidae. It is endemic to India: it is only known from its type locality in Kodagu district, Karnataka, in southern India. The type specimen is lost, and this name might be a junior synonym of Sphaerotheca breviceps.
