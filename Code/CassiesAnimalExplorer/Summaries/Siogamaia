Siogamaia is a small genus of very small sea snails, pyramidellid gastropod mollusks or micromollusks. This genus is currently placed in the subfamily Chrysallidinae of the family Odostomiidae. The genus was originally described as a subgenus of Tropaeas Dall & Bartsch, 1904, but was later erected to a full genus and placed within Chysallidinae by Schander et al. (1999).
