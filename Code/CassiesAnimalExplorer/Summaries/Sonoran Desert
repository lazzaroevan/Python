The Sonoran Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Sonora) is a North American desert and ecoregion which covers large parts of the Southwestern United States in Arizona and California and of Northwestern Mexico in Sonora, Baja California, and Baja California Sur. It is the hottest desert in Mexico. It has an area of  260,000 square kilometers (100,000 sq mi). The western portion of the United Statesâ€“Mexico border passes through the Sonoran Desert.
In phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran Floristic Province of the Madrean Region in southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic Kingdom of the northern Western Hemisphere.  The desert contains a variety of unique and endemic plants and animals, such as the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi).
The Sonoran desert is distinct from nearby deserts (e.g., the Great Basin, Mojave, and Chihuahuan Deserts) because it provides subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall as opposed to the Mojave's dry summers and cold winters. This creates an extreme contrast between aridity and moisture.
