Stenothecidae is an extinct family of fossil univalved Cambrian molluscs which may be either gastropods or monoplacophorans.
The name of this taxon should not be confused with that of the class Stenothecoida, a group of problematic Cambrian invertebrates that have a bivalved (dorsal and ventral) shell.
