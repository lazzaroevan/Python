Steatoda grossa, commonly known as the cupboard spider, the dark comb-footed spider, the brown house spider (in Australia), or the false widow (though several other species are known by these names), is a common species of spider in the genus Steatoda.
It is a cosmopolitan species found in many parts of the world, including North America, Australasia, and Europe. 
As one of this spider's common names indicates, the spider superficially resembles, and is frequently confused for, the black widow and other venomous spiders in the genus Latrodectus.
