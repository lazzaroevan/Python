Paroplocephalus is a genus of venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The genus is monotypic, containing only the species Paroplocephalus atriceps, the Lake Cronin snake. The species is endemic to western Australia.
A poorly known species, its diet includes lizards. It is active during the night and day, and is possibly arboreal. The largest specimen is recorded as 60 cm (24 in) in total length (including tail), 48 cm (19 in) from snout to vent. The head is dull black, the eyes large, and the lower lip white-barred. The body is brown to dark brown dorsally, a lighter reddish brown beneath, and has non-shiny scales.A common name derives from the type locality, Lake Cronin, an inland body of water in Western Australia. It is endemic to the wheatbelt region, the few specimens being recorded at this locality and another 145 kilometres (90 miles) east at Peak Eleanora.
