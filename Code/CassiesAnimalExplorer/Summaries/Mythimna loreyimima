Mythimna loreyimima (sugar cane armyworm) is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in Asia and Australia. They term “Armyworm” is used because of their habit to spread out in a line across a lawn or pasture, and slowly “marching” forward, meanwhile consuming the foliage they encounter.

The wingspan is about 35 mm.
The larvae feed on agricultural plants, such as Saccharum officinarum and Poaceae species and are thus considered a pest.
