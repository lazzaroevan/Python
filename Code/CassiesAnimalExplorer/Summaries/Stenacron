Stenacron is a genus of mayflies in the family Heptageniidae.
The genus of Stenacron (Jensen 1974) is a vastly understudied and largely misunderstood genus. From P A Lewis (1974) "The Taxonomy and Ecology of Stenonema Mayflies" forward, very little to nothing has been done with this genus in the field and in laboratories.
