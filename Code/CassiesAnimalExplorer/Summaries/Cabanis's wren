Cabanis's wren (Cantorchilus modestus) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae.
It is found in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. It was considered conspecific with the canebrake wren and the isthmian wren, together called the plain wren.  It is considered as a distinct species because of different vocalizations and genetic divergence.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, and heavily degraded former forest.
