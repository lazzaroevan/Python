Paraschistura chrysicristinae is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Paraschistura. It was recorded from two locations from the Batman River (a tributary of the upper Tigris in Turkey) in the 1970s but has not been recorded since. The habitat in the localities where it was recorded seems to be of good quality so the reasons for its disappearance are unknown.
