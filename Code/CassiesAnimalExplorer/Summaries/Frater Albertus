Frater Albertus Spagyricus (Albert Richard Riedel) born May 5,(1911â€“1984); founder of the Paracelsus Research Society in Salt Lake City, which later evolved into the Paracelsus College.  Based on the Paracelsian concept of three essentials, Body, Soul and Spirit, Frater Albertus developed a system of teaching alchemical concepts using the spagyric technique of separation and cohobation.  The unique graduated courses allowed students to explore aspects of the vegetable, mineral and animal kingdoms in an understandable and accessible way. After his death in 1984, the college ceased operations in the United States but continued to carry on the tradition in Australia.  Frater Albertus had a profound effect on the way Alchemy and particularly the Spagyric method was disseminated and understood in the mid to late 20th century.  His works were translated into many languages. He was a rosicrucian (an AMORC member).
