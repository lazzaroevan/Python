Conasprella delessertii, common name Sozon's cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.This species couldn't be placed in any subgenus of Conasprella and is therefore designated as incertae sedis.
Like all species within the genus Conasprella, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. It was named after Benjamin Delessert (1773â€“1847), a French banker and naturalist.
