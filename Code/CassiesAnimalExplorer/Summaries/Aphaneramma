Aphaneramma is an extinct genus of marine temnospondyl amphibian. It lived during the Early Triassic epoch. Fossils have been found in the Mianwali Formation of Pakistan, Madagascar,  the Zhitkov Formation of Russia, and the Kongressfjellet Formation of Svalbard (Norway).Aphaneramma grew up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) long, with a 23 centimetres (9.1 in) skull. Aphaneramma's jaws were very long, similar to the gharial's, and lined with small teeth.  This adaptation suggests it may have preyed on fish. A marine lifestyle for this animal was proposed. Aphaneramma is closely related to Cosgriffius from North America,
