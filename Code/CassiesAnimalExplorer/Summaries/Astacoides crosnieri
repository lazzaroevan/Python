Astacoides crosnieri is a species of crustacean in family Parastacidae. It is endemic to Madagascar, being widespread in the former Province Fianatantsoa. A. crosnieri inhabits swampy areas at an elevation between 500 â€“ 1000 m above sea level.The populations are threatened by habitate loss and predation pressure from introduced species. 
Since A. crosnieri has a muddy taste and their habitat is difficult to access, A. crosnieri is less targeted by fisheries compared to other species of the genus Astacoides.
