Spiroctenus personatus is a spider in the family Bemmeridae, found in Southern Africa. It was first described in 1889 by Eug√®ne Simon. The male specimen that Simon described was from Maputo Bay, which he called "Baie de Delagoa", in Mozambique. It was about 20 mm long. Its cephalothorax was light grey with a black triangular head region and a brownish centre. The fovea was large. The abdomen was short and oval, the upper surface being black with yellowish markings, the lower pale brick-coloured. The legs were brownish-olive with reddish patellae. The palpal bulb was pear-shaped with a very delicate long embolus.
