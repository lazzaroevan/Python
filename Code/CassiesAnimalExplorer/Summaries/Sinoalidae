Sinoalidae is an extinct family of froghoppers known from the late Middle Jurassic to the early Late Cretaceous of Asia. They are one of two main Mesozoic families of froghoppers, alongside Procercopidae, unlike Procercopidae, Sinoalidae is thought to be an extinct side branch and not ancestral to modern froghoppers. Sinoalids have a temporally disjunct distribution being only known from the late Middle Jurassic (Callovian) Yanliao Biota of Inner Mongolia and the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber of Myanmar, separated by over 60 million years. The family is "recognized by its tegmen with the costal area and clavus commonly more sclerotized and punctate than the remaining part, and its hind tibia with two rows of lateral spines"
