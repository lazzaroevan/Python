The Hoplitidae is a family of Cretaceous ammonites that lived during the middle of the period from the late Aptian to the Cenomanian.  They are part of the superfamily Hoplitoidea.
Members of the Hoplitidae are typically evolute, with inner whorls exposed, although some are more involute, and are commonly stout and strongly ribbed, with pronounced tubercles.
The Hoplitidae are thought to be derived from the U Aptian -M Albian Uligella of the Desmoceratidae, or some related form and have been divided into three subfamilies.
