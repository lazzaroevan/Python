Atoposaurus is an extinct genus of crocodylomorph. It is the type genus of the family Atoposauridae. Fossils have been found that were Late Jurassic in age from two distinct species in France and Germany.
One interesting feature of Atoposaurus is that it lacked dorsal scutes, a common characteristic of atoposaurids as well as most crurotarsans. The absence of scutes, along with its relatively small size (specimens reach lengths of up to 17 cm), narrow supratemporal fossae, wide occipital region, thin postorbital bar, and smooth ornamentation, has led some paleontologists to believe that it is perhaps a juvenile form of another genus within Atoposauridae, most likely Alligatorellus.
