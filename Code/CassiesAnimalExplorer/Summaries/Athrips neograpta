Athrips neograpta is a moth of the family Gelechiidae first described by Edward Meyrick in 1914. It is found in Namibia and South Africa.The wingspan is 11â€“13 mm. The forewings are white, with scattered black specks and a pale ochreous streak from the base beneath the costa, terminating in a spot surrounding a dot of raised black scales representing the first discal stigma. There is a pale ochreous streak along the fold throughout, marked with a black plical stigma very obliquely before the first discal, and interrupted beyond this. There is also some faint ochreous suffusion towards the dorsum and a pale ochreous transverse streak at three-fourths parallel to the termen, marked with a black raised spot above the tornus. A pale ochreous streak is found along the termen and there is a series of irregular black dots or groups of scales around the posterior part of the costa and termen. The hindwings are grey.
