Lophopidae is a family of fulgoroid plant-hoppers with most species found in tropical South America and Asia (two genera occur in Africa). Most members of the family are characterized by the face being longer than wide with at least two lateral ridges (the median ridge/carina may be absent). The hind tibia can bear some spines, two to three (about four may be seen in the Eurybrachyidae). Lateral ocelli are present below the compound eye and slightly in front of it. The wings are broad and held somewhat flat and the wings are often patterned. The nymphs have two long tails and many members have slightly flattened front tibiae.
