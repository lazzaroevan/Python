Duttaphrynus stomaticus, also known as the Indian marbled toad, Punjab toad, Indus Valley toad, or marbled toad, is a species of toad found in Asia from eastern Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan to Nepal, extending into Peninsular India and Bangladesh.

This toad lacks cranial crests and the space between the eyes is broader than the upper eyelid. The tympanum of the ear is two-thirds the diameter of the eye. The first and second fingers are nearly equal and there is a single sub-articular tubercle. A spiny ridge is found on the tarsus. There is a tibial gland and the parotoid is longer than broad. Three dark bands run transversely on the forearm. The underside is whitish with dark mottling on the throat.
