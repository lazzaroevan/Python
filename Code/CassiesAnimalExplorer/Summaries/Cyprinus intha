Cyprinus intha is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Cyprinus. The species is only known from Inle Lake, a large, isolated freshwater lake on the Shan Plateau in eastern Myanmar. It is considered to be Endangered, among other reasons, because of widespread hybridization with introduced Common Carp, Cyprinus carpio.
