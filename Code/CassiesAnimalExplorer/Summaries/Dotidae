Dotidae are a taxonomic family of small sea slugs, nudibranchs, shell-less marine gastropod molluscs formerly assigned to the order Opisthobranchia, but now considered to belong to the clade Dexiarchia. This family is unassigned to a superfamily.
This family has also been spelled in the past as "Dotonidae" and "Dotoidae". The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) decided in 1964 that neither spelling was correct and adopted Dotidae  Gray, 1853 as the accepted name for this family.
