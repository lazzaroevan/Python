The genus Arctophoca is a proposed genus of pinnipeds, containing most species of fur seal. Usually, all fur seals are included in the genus Arctocephalus, but recent studies has shown the genus to be paraphyletic. In that case, only the brown fur seal remains in Arctocephalus, while the genus Arctophoca is resurrected for the remaining species. This split is however not yet official.
