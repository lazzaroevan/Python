Mantoididae is a family of order Mantodea which contains Neotropical species of praying mantises from tropical North and South America. The family was formerly represented by the sole genus Mantoida, however the genus Paramantoida was described in 2014 and Vespamantoida in 2019. The family differs from the closely related Chaeteessidae in having an apical claw on the fore tibiae which are also less curved. Males have ocelli and a cylindrical body shape, unlike the dorsoventrally flattened Chaeteessidae. The cerci are also shorter.
