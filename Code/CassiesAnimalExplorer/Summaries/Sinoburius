Sinoburius is an extinct genus of Xandarellid artiopodan known from the Cambrian aged Chengjiang Biota of China. It is only known from the type species S. lunaris, which was described in 1991. It is a rare fossil within the Chengjiang assemblage. Like other Xandarellids, Sinoburius has an unmineralised exoskeleton. Adult individuals are around 7-8 millimetres in length, with stalked eyes present on the ventral side.
