Palerontobia is a monotypic tiger moth genus in the family Erebidae. Its only species, Palerontobia kozlovi, is found in north-eastern Tibet (China, Qinghai). Both the genus and species were first described by Vladimir Viktorovitch Dubatolov in 2008. The generic name consists of two parts: "pale" is a part of the genus name Palearctia, and "rontobia" is a part of the genus name Orontobia. The specific name is after Pyotr Kozlov, a disciple of Nikolay Przhevalsky, who first collected the holotype in 1900.
