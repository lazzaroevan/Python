It is often treated as a subspecies of P. ventralis, but some authorities prefer to treat them as separate species. It is endemic to reefs at depths of 26–219 m (85–719 ft) in Hawaii and the Johnston Atoll.It reaches 10 cm (3.9 in) in length and is bright yellow, orange, red and purple. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade, but it is a difficult species to maintain.
