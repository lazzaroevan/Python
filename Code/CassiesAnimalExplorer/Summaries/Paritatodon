Paritatodon is an extinct mammal which existed in Kyrgyzstan and England during the Jurassic period. It was originally the holotype specimen of Shuotherium kermacki, but Martin and Averianov (2010) argued that it resembled the genus Itatodon (Docodonta) and so renamed it Paritatodon.
Nonetheless, recent phylogenetic studies assign it (and Itatodon) to Shuotheriidae.Like many Mesozoic mammals, this species is only known from its teeth, in this case two lower molars from the Forest Marble Formation in England, and a single left lower molar from the Balabansai Formation in the Fergana Depression, Kyrgyzstan.
