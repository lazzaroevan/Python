Phobaeticus serratipes (formerly known as Pharnacia serratipes) is a species of stick insect  that at one time was the longest known insect, with one female specimen recorded as being 555 mm long. This measurement includes the legs fully extended front and rear, and the actual length of the body alone is considerably shorter. This insect is endemic to Malaysia and Singapore. It is a popular species among those who raise stick insects.
The record for longest known insect is now held by an unnamed species of Phryganistria measuring 624 mm, held in the Insect Museum of West China in Chengdu. Phobaeticus serratipes is also slightly shorter in body length than one specimen of Phobaeticus kirbyi.
