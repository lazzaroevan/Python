Pseudochorthippus is a genus of grasshoppers in the tribe Gomphocerini.   Insects including the 'meadow grasshopper' were previously placed in the genus Chorthippus, but are now placed here in species group parallelus (Zetterstedt, 1821).  Species have been recorded from Western Europe, throughout temperate Asia and North America.
