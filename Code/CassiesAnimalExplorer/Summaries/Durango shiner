The Durango shiner (Notropis aulidion) is an extinct species of freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae. It was found only in Mexico. No essential further information on this species is given in the standard references of FishBase and IUCN Red List. The Durango shiner was native to the Rio Tunal, which forms the headwaters of the San Pedro Mezquital River, a Pacific slope river rising near Durango City, Durango, Mexico (Chernoff and Miller
1986). It was taken there only in 1951 and 1961. Its closest relatives were the yellow shiner and the Ameca shiner.
