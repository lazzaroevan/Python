Phyllonorycter didymopa is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from South Africa and Namibia.
The length of the forewings is 2.9â€“3.2 mm. The forewings are elongate and the ground colour is ochreous brown with white markings. The hindwings are light, beige with a long light beige, slightly shiny fringe. Specimens were reared from mines collected in mid-January and mid-March.The larvae feed on Dombeya rotundifolia. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a long, narrow gallery, mainly along the edge of the leaf. Later it creates a gall-like swelling near the base of the disc.
