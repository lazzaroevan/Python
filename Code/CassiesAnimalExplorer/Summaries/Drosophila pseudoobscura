Drosophila pseudoobscura is a species of fruit fly, used extensively in lab studies of speciation. It is native to western North America.
In 2005, D. pseudoobscura was the second Drosophila species to have its genome sequenced, after the model organism Drosophila melanogaster.Allopatric speciation has been induced by reproductive isolation in D. pseudoobscura after only eight generations using different food types, starch and maltose.
