Cornufer hedigeri, commonly known as the Treasury wrinkled ground frog or Solomon Islands giant treefrog, is a species of frog in the family Ceratobatrachidae, named after Henry B. Guppy who collected the holotype from the Treasury Islands. It is widespread in the Solomon Islands archipelago (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), though it is missing from New Georgia and Makira islands.
