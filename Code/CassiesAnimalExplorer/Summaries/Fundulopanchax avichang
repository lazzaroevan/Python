Fundulopanchax avichang is a species of African killifish that mainly inhabits small temporary pools of the Ecucu River drainage systems. The species is endemic to Equatorial Guinea. Adult fish reach a maximum length of approximately 2.6 centimetres (1.0 inch). Breeding pairs of the species most often lay their eggs over the bottom, but occasionally also among the roots of free-floating aquatic plants. Pairs stay close for some time, with just a few eggs being produced each day.
