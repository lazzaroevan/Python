Cosmopepla conspicillaris is a species of insect in the family Pentatomidae first described by William Dallas in 1851. Due to its common preference for plants in the genus Stachys, it is often called the hedgenettle stink bug. It is also known as the conspicuous stink bug, two-spotted stink bug or happy bespectacled stink bug depending on locality. The name two-spotted stink bug is better applied  to another species, Perillus bioculatus (Fabricius, 1775).
