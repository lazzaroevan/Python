The aurochs ( or ; pl. aurochs, or rarely aurochsen, aurochses) (Bos primigenius), also known as urus or ure, is an extinct species of large wild cattle that inhabited Asia, Europe, and North Africa. It is the ancestor of domestic cattle. The species survived in Europe until 1627, when the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktor√≥w Forest, Poland.
During the Neolithic Revolution, which occurred during the early Holocene, at least two aurochs domestication events occurred: one related to the Indian subspecies, B. p. namadicus  leading to zebu cattle, and the other related to the Eurasian subspecies Bos p. primigenius, leading to taurine cattle. Other species of wild bovines were also domesticated, namely the wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), gaur (Bos gaurus), wild yak (Bos mutus), and banteng (Bos javanicus). In modern cattle, many breeds share characteristics of the aurochs, such as a dark colour in the bulls, with a light eel stripe along the back (the cows being lighter), or an aurochs-like horn shape.
