Percina is a genus of small freshwater ray-finned fish, classified within the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches from North America. Like the similar fishes in the genus Etheostoma, they are some species called "darters". More specifically, the genus as a whole is known as roughbelly darters, while certain species of Percina with a pattern of vertical bars on the flanks are called logperches.
