Aubria subsigillata, commonly known as the brown ball frog or the West African brown frog, is a species of frog belonging to the family Pyxicephalidae. It has a discontinuous distribution from southern Guinea through Liberia and Ivory Coast, and from Nigeria to southern Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea to Gabon (with, at least apparently, a gap in Togo and Benin). However, the species delimitation differs between sources (see below), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature  has adopted a narrower view where this species only occurs in Cameroon and southward.
