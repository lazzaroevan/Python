Malacosteus niger is a species of fish in the family Stomiidae, the barbeled dragonfishes. It is known by the common names northern stoplight loosejaw, lightless loosejaw, black loosejaw,  and black hinged-head. It lives in oceans around the world from tropical to subarctic waters where it feeds primarily on zooplankton, but is also known to consume piscivores. Its unique visual and bioluminescence permit it to see the red light produced by its photophores which most other species cannot perceive, thus making M. niger an apex predator in its ecosystem.
