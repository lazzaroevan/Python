Flabellum pavoninum is a species of deep sea coral belonging to the family Flabellidae. It is found in the western Indo-Pacific Ocean at depths varying from 73 to 665 m (240 to 2,182 ft). They are sometimes known as dentures of the sea because of the perceived resemblance of the corallum (skeleton) to a set of dentures.
