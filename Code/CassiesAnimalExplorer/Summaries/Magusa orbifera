Magusa orbifera is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found from southern Florida through the Florida Keys to the Caribbean. The species is commonly known as Orbed Narrow-wing, but this name may also be applied to Magusa divaricata, which was treated as a synonym until recently.
The wingspan is 34 mm. Adults are on wing year-round.
The larvae feed on Krugiodendron ferreum and Karwinskia humboldtiana.
