Liturgusa krattorum, or the Kratt's Lichen Mantis, is a species of mantis that was discovered by Dr. Gavin Svenson and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. These species of mantis are mainly found in Peru. They live in tall trees, are ambush predators, and are also fast runners mainly because they hunt other insects. The species was named after Martin Kratt and Chris Kratt, the hosts of Kratts' Creatures, Zoboomafoo, and Wild Kratts on PBS Kids, as well as Be the Creature on National Geographic.
