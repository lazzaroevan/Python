Myzozoa is a grouping of specific phyla within Alveolata, that either feed through myzocytosis, or were ancestrally capable of feeding through myzocytosis.Many protozoan orders are included within Myzozoa.It is sometimes described as a phylum, containing the major subphyla Dinozoa and Apicomplexa, plus minor subphyla.The term Myzozoa superseded the previous term "Miozoa", by the same authority, and gave a slightly altered meaning.
