Dalpiazia is a prehistoric genus of sclerorhynchid sawfish whose fossils are found in rocks dating from the Maastrichtian stage in mines in Jordan and Syria, and in Morocco. The type species D. stromeri was named in honor of Ernst Stromer.
The validity of Dalpiazia has been questioned on the basis of its similarities to Ischyrhiza, a subgenus of Onchosaurus.
