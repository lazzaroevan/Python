In literature prior to 2011, this species may have been confused with Paramesotriton chinensis, Pachytriton granulosus, or Paramesotriton ermizhaoi (the last now in synonymy). This species has several vernacular names, including Unterstein's newt, spotless stout newt, spotless smooth warty newt, Zhao Ermi's smooth warty newt, and paddletail newt.
