Cornops aquaticum is a semiaquatic species of grasshopper native to the Neotropics, from southern Mexico south to central Argentina and Uruguay. It feeds and breeds exclusively on members of the aquatic plant family Pontederiaceae, especially water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and is being investigated as a possible biological pest control agent for the water hyacinth in countries where that plant is invasive.Although its semiaquatic behavior is unusual, it is not unique. In South America alone there are more than 50 species of orthopterans that are associated with water, including a few relatively well-known species like Paulinia acuminata, which is used for control of the plant Salvinia molesta.
