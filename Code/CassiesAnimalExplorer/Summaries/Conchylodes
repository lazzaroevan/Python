Conchylodes is a genus of snout moths in the family Crambidae. The genus comprises 21 species and is placed in the tribe Udeini.Recently, the monotypic genus Nonazochis, described by Hans Georg Amsel in 1956, was synonymized with Conchylodes. This led to the transfer of its type species, Azochis graphialis, to Conchylodes as Conchylodes graphialis.
