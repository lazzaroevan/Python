Cryptobatrachus is a genus of frogs under family Hemiphractidae. They are found in Colombia and Venezuela. They are commonly called backpack frogs, as the females have the habit of carrying their clutch on their backs until the young hatch; this behaviour also occurs in the related hemiphractid genera Hemiphractus and Stefania.
