The Sierran chorus frog or Sierran treefrog (Pseudacris sierra) has a range from the West Coast of the United States from Central California inland through Idaho. They live from sea level to more than 10,000 feet in many types of habitats, reproducing in aquatic settings. They occur in shades of greens or browns and can change colors over periods of hours and weeks.
