Starksia hassi, the ringed blenny, is a species of labrisomid blenny native to the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  It is and inhabitant of coral reefs and can be found at depths of from 6 to 175 m (20 to 574 ft).  This species can reach a length of 4 cm (1.6 in) TL.Starksia hassi can easily move within and below an anemone without being stung by its tentacles, and uses this property for self-defense. It normally rests within the anemone, and hides further into its tentacles when approached.The specific name honours the Austrian biologist and underwater diving pioneer Hans Hass (1919-2013) who was the leader of the expedition on which the type of this species was collected.
