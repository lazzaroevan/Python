Arnoglossus imperialis, the imperial scaldfish, is a species of flatfish from the family of left-eyed flounders, the Bothidae. It occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Scotland south to Namibia, extending into the western Mediterranean. This bottom dwelling species is sometimes caught as bycatch but is of little interest to fisheries.
