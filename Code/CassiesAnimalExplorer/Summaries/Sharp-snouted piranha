The sharp-snouted piranha (Serrasalmus sanchezi) is a species of serrasalmid endemic to Peru. It is part of the S. rhombeus complex. It reaches a maximum size of around 7 inches (18 cm).  Individuals often exhibit a red throat, similar to that of Pygocentrus nattereri. It is also known as ruby-throated diamond piranha or "ruby-red piranha"; the latter name is also used for the speckled piranha (S. spilopleura).
