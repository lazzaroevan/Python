Proconsulidae is an early family of primates that lived during the Miocene epoch in Kenya, and was restricted to Africa.  The family is split into two subfamilies.
Members of the family have a mixture of Old World monkey and ape characteristics, so the placement in the ape superfamily Hominoidea is tentative; some scientists place Proconsulidae outside of Hominoidea in a separately superfamily Proconsuloidea, before the split of the apes and Old World monkeys.
