Sphaenorhynchus platycephalus, commonly known as the South American lime treefrog or Lutz's lime treefrog,  is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is endemic to south-eastern Brazil where it occurs in the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira ranges in the states of Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo, and Minas Gerais. However, Araujo-Vieira and colleagues suggests that the Serra da Mantiqueira population could represent Sphaenorhynchus canga; the two species are similar.
