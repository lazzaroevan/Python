Food storage allows food to be eaten for some time (typically weeks to months) after harvest rather than solely immediately. It is both a traditional domestic skill and, in the form of food logistics, an important industrial and commercial activity. Food preservation, storage, and transport, including timely delivery to consumers, are important to food security, especially for the majority of people throughout the world who rely on others to produce their food. Food is stored by almost every human society and by many animals. Storing of food has several main purposes:

Storage of harvested and processed plant and animal food products for distribution to consumers
Enabling a better balanced diet throughout the year
Reducing food waste by preserving unused or uneaten food for later use
Preserving pantry food, such as spices or dry ingredients like rice and flour, for eventual use in cooking
Preparedness for catastrophes, emergencies and periods of food scarcity or famine
Religious reasons (Example: LDS Church (aka:The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints)  leaders instruct church members to store food)
Protection from animals or theft
