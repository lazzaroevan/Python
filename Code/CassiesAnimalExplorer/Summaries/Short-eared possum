The short-eared possum (Trichosurus caninus) is a species of marsupial in the family Phalangeridae endemic to Australia. Found north of Sydney, the species was once classed as a mountain brushtail possum, which is its closest relative.
In the wild, they can live up to 17 years of age, have a stable territory, and invest significant energy rearing their young.
