Argochampsa (meaning "Argo crocodile", in reference to the mythological Argo of Jason) is an extinct genus of eusuchian crocodylomorph, usually regarded as a gavialoid crocodilian, related to modern gharials.  It lived in the Paleocene of Morocco.  Described by Hua and Jouve in 2004, the type species is A. krebsi, with the species named for Bernard Krebs.  Argochampsa had a long narrow snout, and appears to have been marine in habits.
