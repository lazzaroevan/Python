The genus Selenotypus includes one of the largest of Australia's theraphosids. At present, the only recognised species within this genus is Selenotypus plumipes, but this is expected to change, as it is becoming apparent that the genus has a wide distribution, and at present Australian theraphosids as a whole are poorly classified.
