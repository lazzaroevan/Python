The Peruvian wren (Cinnycerthia peruana) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It formerly included the sepia-brown wren or Sharpe's wren (C. olivascens) and the fulvous wren (C. fulva) as subspecies, but with all three under the common name sepia-brown wren. As presently defined, the Peruvian wren is endemic to dense undergrowth of humid Andean forests in Peru.
