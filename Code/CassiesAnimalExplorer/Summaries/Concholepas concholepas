Concholepas concholepas, the Chilean abalone, is a species of large edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk. Despite the superficial resemblance, C. concholepas is not a true abalone (a species in the family Haliotidae), but a member of the family Muricidae, also known as murex snails or rock snails. This species is native to the coasts of Chile and Peru, where it is called loco (Chilean Spanish a loanword from Mapudungun) or pata de burro and chanque (Peruvian Spanish).
Due to overfishing, the harvesting of this species in Chile has been limited by law since 1989.
