Macopaeus is a genus of jumping spiders endemic to Madagascar. It contains only one species, Macopaeus spinosus. Two other species (M. celebensis Merian, 1911 and M. madagascarensis Peckham & Peckham, 1903) were described in this genus in the early 20th century. However, these were transferred to the genus Brettus in 1980.
