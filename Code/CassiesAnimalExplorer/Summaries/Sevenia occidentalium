Sevenia occidentalium is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. It is found in Sierra Leone, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Angola. The habitat consists of forests.
There may be massive population irruptions, leading to migratory behaviour. Adults males mud-puddle and have also been recorded on civet droppings.
The larvae feed on Macaranga schweinfurthii and Sapium species (including Sapium ellipticum).
