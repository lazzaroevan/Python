Drymophila is a bird genus in the antbird family (Thamnophilidae). It is a relative of the typical antwrens.
The genus Drymophila was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1824. The type species is the ferruginous antbird. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek words drumos for "wood" or "copse" and philos "fond of".
