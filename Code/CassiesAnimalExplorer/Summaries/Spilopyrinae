The Spilopyrinae are a small subfamily of the leaf beetles, or Chrysomelidae. They occur in Australia, New Guinea, New Caledonia and Chile. They were formerly considered a tribe of the subfamily Eumolpinae. The group was elevated to subfamily rank by C. A. M. Reid in 2000. However, some authors have criticised this placement, preferring to retain them within the Eumolpinae.
