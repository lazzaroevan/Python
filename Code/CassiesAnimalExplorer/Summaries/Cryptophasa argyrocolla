Cryptophasa argyrocolla is a moth in the family Xyloryctidae. It was described by Turner in 1917. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Western Australia.
The wingspan is 30â€“36 mm. The forewings have a broad silvery white costal streak from one-eight to the apex, broadest at one-fourth from the base, there angled and gradually narrowing to a point at the apex. There is a broad brownish suffusion beneath the costal streak towards the base and a transversely oval, black-edged, brownish spot at two-thirds, indenting the costal streak. Some whitish suffusion is found before the tornus and there is a blackish dentate subterminal line, edged posteriorly with brownish. The hindwings are grey.
