Lovenellidae is a family of hydrozoans. Their hydroids live together in upright stolonal or sympodial colonies, and their gonophores are pedunculate free-roaming medusae. The relationships of this fairly small but distinctive radiation to other members of the order Leptothecata are not well understood at present.
