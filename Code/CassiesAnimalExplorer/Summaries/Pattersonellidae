Pattersonellidae is an extinct family of primitive ray-finned fish. It is tentatively classified under the suborder Argentinoidei of the order Argentiniformes (marine smelts and allies).The family was established by Louis Taverne in 1982 when he reclassified Leptolepis formosus (originally described by Ramsay Heatley Traquair) to Pattersonella formosa.
