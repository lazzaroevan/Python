Curculio nucum (nut weevil) is a medium-sized beetle, with an especially elongated snout, characteristic of the Curculionini tribe of the weevil family (Curculionidae). Its larvae develop in hazel nuts Corylus avellana, being a serious pest in hazelnut orchards.  It occurs in most of Europe, from south Sweden, Finland and Great Britain to the Mediterranean.
