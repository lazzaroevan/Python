The Arfak Astrapia (Astrapia nigra) is a species of Astrapia, a group of birds found in the Paradiseidae family of the birds-of-paradise.
In the wild, the bird has hybridised with the black sicklebill creating offspring that were once considered a distinct species, the Elliot's Sicklebill "Epimachus ellioti". While some ornithologists still believe that this bird is a distinct species, possibly critically endangered or even extinct, many now think it was a hybrid between the two species.
