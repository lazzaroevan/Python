(2015), Cylinder has become a subgenus of Conus: Conus (Cylinder) Petuch & Sargent, 2012   represented as Conus Thiele, 1929. The same study found Cylinder to be polyphyletic, but morphologically consistent, possibly corresponding to grades. Conus ammiralis, Conus canonicus and Conus dalli cluster with the type species Conus textile, the others form a separate clade.
