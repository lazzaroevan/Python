The genus name is the New Latin diminutive of Latin corbis, a basket, referring to the shape and ribs of the shell. In many Asian countries, these clams are used as ingredients for soup. In South Korea, there is popular soup made of these species of clams (usually Corbicula japonica, Corbicula fluminea, Corbicula leana) known as 재첩국 (jaechup-guk).
The genus Corbicula includes 16 species described to date. The best known is Corbicula fluminea, an invasive species in many areas of the world.
