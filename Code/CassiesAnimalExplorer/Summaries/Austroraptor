Austroraptor ( AW-stroh-RAP-t…ôr) is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period in what is now Argentina. Austroraptor was a medium-sized, moderately-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore. It is one of the largest dromaeosaurids known, with only Achillobator, Dakotaraptor, and Utahraptor approaching or surpassing it in length.
