F. novaesi inhabits sandy substrates.F. novaesi reaches a length of 10.2 centimetres (4.0 in) SL. As with closely related genera, males of Furcodontichthys show a hypertrophied development of the lips suggesting that this genus is a lip brooder. The presence of conspicuous fringed barbels at the lip corners
is unique among the Loricariinae subfamily.
