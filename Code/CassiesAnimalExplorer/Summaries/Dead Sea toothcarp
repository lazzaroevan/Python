The Dead Sea toothcarp (Aphanius dispar richardsoni) is a subspecies of the Arabian toothcarp that is endemic to the Dead Sea basin, although molecular evidence suggests that it should be regarded as a species. It is threatened by water fluctuation, and the introduction of cichlids and Gambusia. The sub-specific name of this fish honours the Scottish surgeon and naturalist John Richardson (naturalist) (1787-1865) who first reported killifish in the Dead Sea basin.
