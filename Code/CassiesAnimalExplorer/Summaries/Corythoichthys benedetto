Corythoichthys benedetto, commonly known as Benedetto's pipefish, is a species of marine fish of the family Syngnathidae. It inhabits the Indo-West Pacific, near Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia. It is found on algae-covered rocky surfaces and gorgonian sea fans at depths of 5 to 20 metres (16 to 66 ft), where it can grow to lengths of around 7 centimetres (2.8 in). It is usually found alone, although it can be found in groups of up to four individuals. This species is ovoviviparous, with males brooding when they are at lengths of 5 to 5.5 centimetres (2.0 to 2.2 in). The specific name and common name honour the late Italian prime minister Benedetto Craxi (1934-2000).
