Pectodens (meaning "comb tooth") is an extinct genus of archosauromorph reptile which lived during the Middle Triassic in China.  The type and only species of the genus is P. zhenyuensis, named by Chun Li and colleagues in 2017. It may be a member of the Protorosauria; an unusual combination of traits similar (such as the long neck) and dissimilar (such as the absence of a hook on the fifth metatarsal bone) to other members causes  Pectodens to elude exact classification.
A small, slender animal measuring 38 centimetres (15 in) long, Pectodens was named after the peculiar comb-like arrangement of long, conical teeth present in its mouth. Unlike Dinocephalosaurus and the other reptiles that it was preserved with, well-developed joints and claw-like digits indicate that Pectodens was entirely terrestrial. However, its presence in marine deposits suggests that lived relatively close to the coastline.
