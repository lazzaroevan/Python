Mythimna scottii is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It has been recorded from Australia (Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia), Fiji, New Caledonia and Hawaii. But it has been listed as a Species inquirenda and might prove to be a synonym.
The wingspan is about 20 mm. Adults have rusty brown forewings with a dark streak, interrupted by a pale spot. The hindwings are off-white with darker margins.
