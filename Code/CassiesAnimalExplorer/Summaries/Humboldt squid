The jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas), also known as Humboldt squid or jumbo flying squid, is a large, predatory squid living in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is the only known species of the genus Dosidicus of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, family Ommastrephidae.
Humboldt squid typically reach a mantle length of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in), making it the largest member of its family. They are the most important squid worldwide for commercial fisheries, with the catch predominantly landed in Mexico, Peru and Chile. Like other members of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, they possess chromatophores which enable them to quickly change body coloration, known as 'metachrosis'); they notably rapidly flash rapidly from red to white. They have a relatively short lifespan of just 1â€“2 years. They have a reputation for aggression toward humans, although this behavior may possibly occur only during feeding times.
They are most commonly found at depths of 200 to 700 m (660 to 2,300 ft), from Tierra del Fuego to California. This species is spreading north into the waters of the Pacific Northwest, in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska.
