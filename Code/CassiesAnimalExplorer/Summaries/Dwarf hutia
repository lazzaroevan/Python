The dwarf hutia (Mesocapromys nanus) is known only from Cuba. It was last seen in 1937.The hutias are heavily built guinea pig-like rodents with broad rounded heads. They have relatively small eyes and short rounded ears. The average tail and body length of this hutia is unknown. Some hutias have prehensile tails, meaning they are able to use them for gripping and climbing. Unlike the larger litter sizes of many other rodents, the dwarf hutia gave birth to only a single offspring.
The dwarf hutia became Critically Endangered due to loss of habitat and the introduction of mongooses and black rats.  The discovery of tracks and droppings in the Zapata Swamp gives hopes that this species has survived.  It was initially described based on fossil material, but was later found to be extant.
