Coleophora haloxyli is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in Turkestan and Uzbekistan.
The larvae feed on Haloxylon persicum. They create a leafy case, consisting of six sections of branches which gradually enlarge toward the anterior end. There is a small tube at the caudal end of the case through which frass is ejected. The length of the case is 8–9 mm (0.31–0.35 in) and it is chocolate-brown to yellow in color. Larvae can be found from September to October.
