Ctenopharynx pictus is a species of fish in the family Cichlidae. It is restricted to Lake Malawi. It occurs throughout much of the lake, but mainly in rocky habitats at depths of 7–30 m (23–98 ft). It is a mouthbrooder, but the female will often release the young near nesting kampango catfish. Their young are then brought up together.
