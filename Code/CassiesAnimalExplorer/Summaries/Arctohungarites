The shell of Arctohungerites is subdiscoidal, involute, with a  rounded venter, weak sigmoidal folds on the body chamber and a distinct ventral keel on the distal end of the chambered portion.  The suture is ceratitic.
Arctohungerites was found in Middle Triassic (Anisian) sediments in northern Siberia
