The lowland burrowing tree frog or northern casquehead frog (Smilisca fodiens) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is found in south-central Arizona, the United States, and southward along the coastal plain and foothills to Western and South-Central Mexico. Its natural habitats are open mesquite grassland and tropical scrub forests at elevations from near sea level to about 1,490 m (4,890 ft) above sea level. It is a burrowing frog that is common in rain-filled temporary pools, its breeding habitat. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by agricultural development. However, many well-preserved populations have been recorded.
