Lophothorax is a monotypic moth genus in the family Geometridae. It consists of only one species, Lophothorax eremnopis, which is found in Australia (South Australia and Western Australia). Both the genus and the species were first described by Alfred Jefferis Turner, the species in 1922 and the genus in 1939.
The wings are mottled brown, slightly greyish, dark on the forewings and paler on the hindwings.
The larvae feed on Dodonaea bursariifolia. They are green, slightly darker dorsally, sometimes with a broken whitish line. They are firm and plump when fully grown. The resting posture varies from rigid and fairly straight to arched, twisted or curved.
