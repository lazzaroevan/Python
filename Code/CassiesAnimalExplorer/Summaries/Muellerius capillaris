Muellerius capillaris, also known as the hair or goat lungworm, is one of the most economically important nematodes of small ruminants. Although normally non-pathogenic in sheep, the parasite causes a disease condition called muelleriosis in goats. Sheep and goats commonly become infected after accidentally ingesting M. capillaris infected snails or slugs, and the parasite produces eggs in the lungs of its host, causing life-threatening bronchopneumonia in serious cases.
