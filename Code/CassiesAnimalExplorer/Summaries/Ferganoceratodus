Ferganoceratodus is a genus of prehistoric lungfish which lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. It is a basal member of the suborder Ceratodontoidei. Despite only being known from Mesozoic-aged rocks, phylogenetic analyses indicate that it diverged from the rest of the suborder during the late Carboniferous.
