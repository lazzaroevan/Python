Garra barreimiae, the Oman garra, is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae. It is found in the mountains of northern Oman and in the United Arab Emirates. Most populations inhabit wadis, streams, pools and springs, but one population which lives in a cave system, is known as Omani blind cave fish, and has lost its sight and pigmentation. The only other cave fish in the Arabian Peninsula is the Tawi Atair garra (G. dunsirei), but it has normal eyes.
