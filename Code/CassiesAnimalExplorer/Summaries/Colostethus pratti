Colostethus pratti is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is found in the northwestern Colombia (Antioquia, Chocó, Córdoba, and Risaralda Departments) and Panama, possibly also in southeastern Costa Rica. It is sometimes known as the Pratt's rocket frog. Colostethus pratti is named after Antwerp Edgar Pratt, an explorer who collected the type series.
