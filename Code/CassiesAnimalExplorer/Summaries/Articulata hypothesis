The Articulata hypothesis is the grouping in a higher taxon of animals with segmented bodies, consisting of Annelida and Panarthropoda. This theory states that these groups are descended from a common segmented ancestor.  The Articulata hypothesis is an alternative to the  hypothesis that ecdysis (the shedding of outer cuticle) is a primitive characteristic â€“ this would place Panarthropoda in the group Ecdysozoa.
