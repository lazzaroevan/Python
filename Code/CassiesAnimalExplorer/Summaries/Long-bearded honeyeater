The long-bearded honeyeater (Melionyx princeps), is a bird in the honeyeater family Meliphagidae.
This species was formerly placed in the genus Melidectes. It was moved to the resurrected genus Melionyx based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019. At the same time the common name was changed from "long-bearded melidectes" to "long-bearded honeyeater".
