Arturia dubia is a species of calcareous sponge in the genus Arturia from Australia. The species was first described as Leucosolenia dubia by Arthur Dendy in 1891. The name is derived from Dendy's uncertainty about the validity of the species, believing his specimens could, in fact, represent juvenile Leucosolenia cavata (now Ascaltis cavata).
