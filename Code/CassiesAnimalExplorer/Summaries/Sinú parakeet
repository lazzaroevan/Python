The Sinú parakeet (Pyrrhura subandina) is a species of bird. It is only known with certainty from the Sinú Valley in northern Colombia. BirdLife International estimates that if the bird is not already extinct, no more than 50 likely exist. Despite extensive searches, there have been no confirmed records of the parakeet since 1949. Scientists know very little about the Sinú parakeet's reproductive physiology, nutritional needs, ecology, or behavior. There are 18 specimens known from four locations in Colombia, two of which have been deforested. The parakeet is among the 25 “most wanted lost” species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation's “Search for Lost Species” initiative.
