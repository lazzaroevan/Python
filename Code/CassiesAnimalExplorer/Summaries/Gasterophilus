The Gasterophilus, commonly known as botfly, is a parasitic fly from the family Oestridae that affects different types of animals, especially horses, but it can also act on cows, sheep, goats and, even, it has been recorded a case in a human baby.This parasite affects the animal gastrointestinal tract in order to give to their offspring an alimentary source.
Although not deadly, due to the usual low larva population that infests the animal, large larva populations can cause health issues to the host. For  example, a typical horse can tolerate a hundred larvae without any effects.
