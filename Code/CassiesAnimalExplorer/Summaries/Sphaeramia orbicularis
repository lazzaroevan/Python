It is found in coastal areas throughout much of the Indo-Pacific, including off East Africa, Kiribati, the Ryukyu Islands, New Caledonia, Belau, and the eastern Caroline and Mariana Islands.The male incubates the eggs until they hatch.  It eats mostly planktonic crustaceans, mainly at night. It is not a common marine aquarium fish.
