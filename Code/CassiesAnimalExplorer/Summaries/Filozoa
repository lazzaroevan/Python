The Filozoa are a monophyletic grouping within the Opisthokonta. They include animals and their nearest unicellular relatives (those organisms which are more closely related to animals than to fungi or Mesomycetozoa).Three groups are currently assigned to the clade Filozoa:

Group Filasterea - recently erected to house the genera Ministeria and Capsaspora
Group Choanoflagellatea - collared flagellates
Kingdom Animalia - the animals proper
