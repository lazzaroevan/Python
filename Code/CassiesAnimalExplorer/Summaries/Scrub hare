The scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis) is one of two subspecies of hares found in southern Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho. Although it is listed as a least critical species, the population has been declining and is expected to decline by 20% until the year 2104. The species is endemic to southern Africa and has not been seen in any other geographic locations around the world.
