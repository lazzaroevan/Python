Palaeophiidae is an extinct family of marine snake  within the infraorder Alethinophidia.
Species within this family lived from the Late Cretaceous to the Late Eocene, approximately from 70.6 to 33.9 million years ago. Phylogenetic evidence supports them being closely related to the extant file snakes (family Acrochordidae).
