Macrotritopus defilippi, commonly known as the Lilliput longarm octopus or the Atlantic longarm octopus, is a small species of octopus, a marine cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda.This species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. Its typical habitat is shallow sandy areas. Its yellowish-brown colouration enables it to blend into its surroundings making it well-camouflaged when stationary. In the Caribbean it has been found that when it moves around, it does so in such a way as to closely resemble the swimming behaviour of the plate fish (Bothus lunatus), a bottom-dwelling flounder which inhabits the same waters.
