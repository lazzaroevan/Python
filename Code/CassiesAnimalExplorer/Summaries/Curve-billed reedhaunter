The curve-billed reedhaunter (Limnornis curvirostris) is a species of bird in the family Furnariidae. It is found in marshy areas of north-eastern Argentina, south-eastern Brazil, and Uruguay. It occupies a similar ecological niche to some reed warblers.
The curve-billed reedhaunter is placed in the monotypic genus Limnornis. The superficially similar straight-billed reedhaunter is sometimes also included in Limnornis, but evidence suggests it is closer to Cranioleuca spinetails than it is to the curve-billed reedhaunter.
