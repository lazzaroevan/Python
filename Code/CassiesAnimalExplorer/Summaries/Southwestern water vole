The southwestern water vole or southern water vole (Arvicola sapidus) is a large amphibious vole native to most of France and southwestwards through Spain and Portugal.  It is listed on the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. Although historically considered to be a member of the same species as the European water vole, Musser and Carleton (2005) considered it distinct enough to warrant full species status.  It is threatened for many of the same reasons as the European water vole, and a campaign is currently underway to seek protection for the species, both at a national level and at European Union level.
It was traditionally one of the main ingredients in the Valencian dish called paella.
