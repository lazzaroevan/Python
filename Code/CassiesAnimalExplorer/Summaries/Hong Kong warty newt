The Hong Kong warty newt or Hong Kong newt (Paramesotriton hongkongensis, see also the synonyms) is the only species of salamander (also known as the "tailed amphibian"), found in Hong Kong. Once thought to be endemic to the territory, the species has also been found in the coastal parts of Guangdong Province.
The newt is treated by some naturalists as a subspecies of Paramesotriton chinensis. However, some disagree with such a classification based on the disjunctive distribution of the two, and the differences in their physical appearance and habitat preference.
