Myrmaplata plataleoides (syn.: Myrmarachne plataleoides), also called the Kerengga ant-like jumper, is a jumping spider that mimics the Kerengga or weaver ant (Oecophylla smaragdina) in morphology and behaviour. This species is found in India, Sri Lanka, China and many parts of Southeast Asia.
Unlike the weaver ants, M. plataleoides does not bite people, and indeed seems rather timid.
