Patriofelis ("father of cats")  was a large, cat-like oxyaenid of middle Eocene in North America. It was around 1.2 to 1.8 metres (3.9 to 5.9 ft) long, not including the tail, and weighed about 40â€“90 kg, making it around the same size as a modern cougar. It had short legs with broad feet, suggesting that it may have been a poor runner, but a quite good swimmer. As its close relative Oxyaena was a reasonably good climber, it is possible Patriofelis could climb as well. It is found in particular in the Bridger Basin of southwestern Wyoming and at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, in the U.S. state of Oregon.
