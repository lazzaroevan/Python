Drymonia dodonaea, the marbled brown, is a moth of the family Notodontidae. The species was first described by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. It is found in Europe and in the area surrounding the Caucasus.

The wingspan is 33–38 mm. Similar to Drymonia ruficornis, but the forewings are generally whiter; the crosslines are less straight, and there is no black crescent above the centre of the wings. The moth flies from May to July depending on the location.
The larvae feed on various deciduous trees, primarily Quercus but also Fagus and Betula.
