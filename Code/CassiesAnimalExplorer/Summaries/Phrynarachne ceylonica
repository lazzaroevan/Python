Phrynarachne ceylonica, the bird dung spider, is a species of spiders of the genus Phrynarachne. It is found in China, Japan, Sri Lanka and Taiwan. The species is known to discharge foul smell, which may help it attract prey and deter predators. Its morphology is similar to bird's dung, and hence its common name. This strategy is used by the spider to catch prey who thinks that it is actually dung, not an animal.
