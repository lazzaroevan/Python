Maritrema subdolum is a species of parasitic fluke found in the Wadden Sea.  It is related to the New Zealand species Maritrema novaezealandensis, and like its New Zealand relative, Maritrema subdolum infects local amphipods, in this case, Corophium volutator and Corophium arenarium.  The cercariae of M. subdolum emerge from the first intermediate host, a gastropod of the genus Hydrobia for example, and seek out the next host, a crustacean. There the cercariae develop into metacercariae and form metacercarial cysts of different sizes.
