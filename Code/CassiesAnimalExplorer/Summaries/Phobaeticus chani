Phobaeticus chani or Chan's megastick is a species of stick insect in the tribe Pharnaciini. It is one of the longest insects in the world and was once considered the record-holder (it is currently held by an unnamed species of Phryganistria discovered in 2016). One specimen held in the Natural History Museum in London measures 567 mm (22.3 in). This measurement is, however, with the front legs fully extended. The body alone still measures an impressive 357 mm (14.1 in).Named after amateur Malaysian naturalist Datuk Chan Chew Lun, only six specimens are known, all originating from the state of Sabah in Borneo. Very little is known about its biology. The related Phobaeticus kirbyi is commonly found on low-growing vegetation alongside rainforest paths.Phobaeticus chani was selected as one of "The Top 10 New Species" described in 2008 by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University and an international committee of taxonomists.  The species was also listed as one of the top 10 discoveries of the decade in the BBC television documentary Decade of Discovery, first broadcast on December 14, 2010.
