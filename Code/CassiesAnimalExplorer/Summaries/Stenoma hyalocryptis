Stenoma hyalocryptis is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1930. It is found in Par√°, Brazil.The wingspan is about 13 mm. The forewings are light violet grey with the extreme costal edge ochreous whitish and the discal stigmata moderate and black, the plical forming a large irregular black spot obliquely beyond the first discal, partly whitish edged. There is a blackish elongate mark on the middle of the costa and a somewhat inwards-oblique streak of dark grey suffusion from the tornus, pointing to the second discal stigma but not reaching it. There are three blackish dots in an oblique series towards the costa about three-fourths, and a curved series of minute blackish dots on veins 3-7 near the termen. The hindwings are iridescent violet hyaline, thinly strewn with light greyish hairscales except in the cell.
