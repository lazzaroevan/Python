Atypus, also called purseweb spiders, is a genus of  atypical tarantulas first described by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1804. It occurs in Eurasia, with one species (A. affinis) reaching into North Africa, and one species (A. snetsingeri) in the USA. Only three of the described species occur in Europe: A. piceus, A. affinis, and A. muralis.Peasants in the southern Carpathian Mountains used to cut up tubes built by Atypus and cover wounds with the inner lining. It reportedly facilitated healing, and even connected with the skin. This is believed to be due to antiseptic properties of spider silk (which is made of protein).
