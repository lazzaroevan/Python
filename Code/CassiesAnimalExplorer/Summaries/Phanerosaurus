Phanerosaurus is an extinct genus of diadectid reptiliomorph from the Early Permian of Germany. Fossils are known from the Leukersdorf Formation near Zwickau. German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer named the type species P. naumanni in 1860 on the basis of several sacral and presacral vertebrae. A second species, P. pungnax, was named in 1882 but placed in its own genus Stephanospondylus in 1905.
