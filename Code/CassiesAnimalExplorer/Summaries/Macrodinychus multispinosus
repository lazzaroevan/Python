Macrodinychus multispinosus is a mite that lives as an ectoparasitoid on the invasive Paratrechina longicornis.  These mites complete their development on a single host, sucking all of its body content and therefore killing it.  This is the ninth species of Macrodinychus reported as ant parasite, and the third known as parasitoid of invasive ants, confirming a unique habit in the evolution of mite feeding strategies and suggesting that the entire genus might be parasitic on ants.
