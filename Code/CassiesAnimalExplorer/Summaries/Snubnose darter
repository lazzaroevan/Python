The snubnose darter (Etheostoma simoterum) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish, a darter from the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. It is endemic to the southeastern United States.
The snubnose darter has two recognized subspecies, including the Cumberland snubnose darter. E. s. atripinne, and the Tennessee snubnose darter, E. s. simoterum.  Intergradation between the two subspecies occurs in the lower Tennessee River unit.  The mean length of snubnose darters is 45 millimetres (1.8 in), the reported average clutch size is 152, and the maximum age is less than two years. The snubnose darter inhabits riffles and rock-bottomed pools in streams with low turbidity. As of 2000, the snubnose darter was listed as currently stable, meaning it is widespread and not in need of any immediate conservation action.
