The Apusozoa are an Obazoa phylum comprising several genera of flagellate eukaryotes. They are usually around 5–20 μm in size, and occur in soils and aquatic habitats, where they feed on bacteria. They are grouped together based on the presence of an organic shell or theca under the dorsal surface of the cell.
The name derives from the Ancient Greek words for footless (ἄπους) and animal (ζῷον).This phylum is currently defined as containing the Breviata and the Apusomonadida. However, it currently usually is viewed as paraphylectic, with the Breviata as more basal. The opisthokonts appear to have emerged as sister of the apusomonadida. It has been suggested that the Mantamonadida be classified in Apusozoa.The ancyromonadida appear to be Varisulca, Planomonadida, shifting them possibly more basal than the Amoebozoa., or less basal. While some classification systems have placed Hemimastigida in Apusozoa, 2018 research indicated that hemimastigotes (Hemimastix kukwesjijk/Hemimastix/Spironemidae) are their own supra-kingdom.
