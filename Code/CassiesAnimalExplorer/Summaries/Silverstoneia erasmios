Silverstoneia erasmios is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is endemic to Colombia where it is known from the Cordillera Occidental and Cordillera Central in the Antioquia Department.Validity of this species is uncertain; females are indistinguishable from Silverstoneia nubicola but males are unknown. Its higher altitudinal range (to 1,940 m (6,360 ft) asl) than Silverstoneia nubicola (maximum elevation 1,300–1,600 m (4,300–5,200 ft)) suggests that it might be a distinct species. Other data (males, vocalizations, DNA samples) are needed to resolve this question.
