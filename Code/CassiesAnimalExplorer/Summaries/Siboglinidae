Siboglinidae is a family of polychaete annelid worms whose members made up the former phyla Pogonophora  and Vestimentifera (the giant tube worms). They are composed of about 100 species of vermiform creatures and live in thin tubes buried in sediments (Pogonophora) or in tubes attached to hard substratum (Vestimentifera) at ocean depths from 100 to 10,000 m (300 to 32,800 ft). They can also be found in association with hydrothermal vents, methane seeps, sunken plant material, or whale carcasses.
The first specimen was dredged from the waters of what is now Indonesia in 1900. These specimens were given to French zoologist Maurice Caullery, who studied them for nearly 50 years.
