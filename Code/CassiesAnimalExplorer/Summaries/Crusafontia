Crusafontia is an extinct genus of mammal from the Cretaceous Camarillas, El Castellar and La Huérguina Formations of Spain.Crusafontia was a 10 cm (3.9 in) long creature that may have looked and lived like a squirrel, but this is uncertain, as only two teeth (an upper molar right P5) and a mandible have ever been found.The name of the animal has been given in honour of the Spanish paleontologist Miquel Crusafont Pairó.
