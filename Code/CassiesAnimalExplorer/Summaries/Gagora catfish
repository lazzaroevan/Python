The Gagora catfish (Arius gagora) is a species of sea catfish in the family Ariidae. It was described by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in 1822, originally under the genus Pimelodus. It is a migratory species found in the tropical marine, brackish and freshwater of Bangladesh, Myanmar, and India. It reaches a maximum standard length of 91.4 cm (36.0 in).The Gagora catfish is of commercial importance as a food fish, but over-fishing has led to a population decline in the past two decades. Due to the decline, the IUCN redlist currently lists the species as Near Threatened.
