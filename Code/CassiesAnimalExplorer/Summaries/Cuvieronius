Cuvieronius is an extinct New World genus of gomphotheres and is named after the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. Alive, specimens typically stood about 2.3 m (7.5 ft) tall at the shoulder, weighed about 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) and would have superficially resembled a modern elephant with spiral-shaped tusks.
