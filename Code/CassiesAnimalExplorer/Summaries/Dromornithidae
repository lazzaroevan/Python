Dromornithidae, also commonly referred to as mihirungs, thunder birds or demon ducks, were a clade of large, flightless Australian birds of the Oligocene through Pleistocene Epochs. All are now extinct. They were long classified in Struthioniformes, but are now usually classified as galloanseres.Dromornithids were part of the Australian megafauna. One species, Dromornis stirtoni, was 3 m (9 ft 10 in) tall. The collective term Australian megafauna is used to describe a number of comparatively large species of animals that lived in Australia until 50,000 to 20,000 years ago. The causes for the disappearance of these animals are under dispute, though hunting by humans has been identified as a potential instigator.It is also not clear to what degree dromornithids were carnivores. The massive, crushing beaks of some species suggest that at least some members of the family were either a combination of carnivorous predators and scavengers or omnivores.  Other features, such as the "hoof-like" feet, stomach structure, and eye structure that resulted in a wide field of vision, but likely also created a centre blind spot of about 40 degrees (which would hinder hunting significantly), suggest a more herbivorous, migratory lifestyle. The current consensus is that they were, indeed, herbivores.The scientific name Dromornithidae derives from the Greek words δρομαίος, dromaios ("swift-running") and ὀρνις, ornis ("bird"). Additionally, the family has been called thunder birds, giant emus, giant runners, demon ducks and mihirungs.
