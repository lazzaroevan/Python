Dysdera is a genus of  woodlouse hunting spiders that was first described by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1804. They originated from Central Asia to Central Europe.
The family has gained many common names from their individual species, including the "European garden spider", the "slater-eating spider", the "sow-bug killer", the "woodlouse hunter", and the "woodlouse spider".A bite from one of these spiders can be painful due to their large fangs and wide jaw. It may leave an itchy, swollen, or red bump, but the venom from one of their bites is not harmful to humans.
