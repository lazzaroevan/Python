Archimantis monstrosa is a species of mantid in the family Mantidae. A. monstrosa, or monster mantis, commonly reaches a length of 90mm or more. It is less common than the often-seen large brown mantis. A. monstrosa that live near the coast can get quite large and sometimes will attack much larger prey.
