Argiope katherina is a species of orb-weaver spider found in the northern parts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It was first described by Levi in 1983 and was named for Katherine Gorge. Specimens had been found at the mouth of split rock crevices up to one hundred metres from the Katherine River in sparse Pandanus-dominated territory.
