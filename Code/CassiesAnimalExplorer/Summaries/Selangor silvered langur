The Selangor silvered langur (Trachypithecus selangorensis) is a species of leaf monkey found on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.  It had been previously considered a form of silvery lutung.  Roos and colleagues elevated this population to a subspecies level, Trachypithecus cristatus selangorensis, in 2008.  It has since come to be regarded by primatologists as a separate species, Trachypithecus selangorensis.
