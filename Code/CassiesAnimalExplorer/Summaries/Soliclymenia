Soliclymenia is a genus of ammonites from the Late Devonian. S. paradoxa has an unusual, triangularly-coiled shell. Additional genera of ammonites with triangular shells are Kamptoclymenia, Trigonoshumardites, and Trigonogastrioceras. Soliclymenia semiparadoxa, which is known only from the holotype, is semi-triangular, the innermost whorls being circular. Other species of this genus, including S. solarioides and S. recticostata, have a circularly-coiled shell.
