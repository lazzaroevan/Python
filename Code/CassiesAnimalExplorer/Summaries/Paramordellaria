Paramordellaria is a genus of tumbling flower beetles in the family Mordellidae. There are at least two described species in Paramordellaria.

Joel Hallan's Biology Catalog, no longer online, shows Paramordellaria ivoirensis as the only species of Paramordellaria. GBIF, ITIS, and Catalogue of Life list the two species P. carinata and P. triloba but not P. ivoirensis.
