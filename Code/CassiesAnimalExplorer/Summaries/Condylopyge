Condylopyge Hawle and Corda (1847)  is a genus of agnostid trilobite that lived during the late Lower and early Middle Cambrian, in what are today Canada (Newfoundland and New Brunswick), the Czech Republic, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, the Russian Federation (North-East Siberia), Spain, Turkey and Sweden. It can easily be distinguished from all other Agnostida because the frontal glabellar lobe is notably wider than the rear lobe. It belongs to the same family as Pleuroctenium but the frontal glabellar lobe does not fold around the rear lobe, as it does in that genus.
Condylopyge is long ranging, possibly spanning the early Cambrian Terreneuvian Series in Nuneaton, central England into at least Drumian strata (middle stage of the Miaolingian Series) at various locations elsewhere.
