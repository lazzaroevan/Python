Scutellonema bradys, also known as yam nematode, is a migratory endoparasitic nematode causing major damage to yam (Dioscorea spp.) crop in many African tropical regions, as well in parts of South and Central America and Asia. They can cause reduction of 20-30% in tuber weight at harvest.
This nematode is able to multiply in dry conditions causing complete rotting tubers, called dry rot, which decreases the commercial value of the tubers. Dry rot of yam occurs in the outer 1â€“2 cm of tubers. Symptoms of dry rot of yam include necrotic lesions beneath the skin, followed by yellow lesions below the outer skin of the tuber. External cracks appear in the skin of the tuber. The infections created by the nematode can serve as external opening facilitating fungi and bacteria colonization, causing wet rot. S. bradys feeds and reproduce in yams stored after harvest. Infested yam tubers are greatly damaged as a result of the continued reproduction of nematode.
