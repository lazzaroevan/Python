The burying mantis (Sphodropoda tristis) is a species of mantid native to Australia. They are white or brown and can reach lengths of up to some 40mm long, with distinct markings on the thorax and with a white blotch on the wings. They're called burying mantids because females dig holes in the ground, in which they lay their eggs and then refill the holes.
Burying mantids are not aggressive, (unlike the large brown mantis); the female does not try to attack the male whilst mating but will kill and eat the male afterwards. The burying mantis can be found in abundance on the Southeast coast of Queensland.
