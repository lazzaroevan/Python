Apostolepis assimilis (common name: Reinhardt's burrowing snake) is a species of snake in the family Colubridae. It is found in central and southwestern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, Bolivia, and northern Argentina; the Reptile Database, however, does not mention Bolivia and treats Argentina as uncertain.
