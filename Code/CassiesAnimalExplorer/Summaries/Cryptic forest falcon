The cryptic forest falcon (Micrastur mintoni) is a species of bird of prey in the family Falconidae. It is found in the south-eastern Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia. While uncommon in its Amazonian range, it remains widespread, and is therefore rated as least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN. Unlike the lined forest falcon, with which it has long been confused in a cryptic species complex, adult cryptic forest falcons only have a single white tail-band (in addition to a narrow white tail-tip).
