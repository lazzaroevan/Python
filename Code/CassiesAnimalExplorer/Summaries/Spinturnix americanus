Spinturnix americanus is a species of mite that parasitizes bat wings. It was described as a new species in 1902 by American entomologist Nathan Banks. Banks initially placed it in the now-defunct genus Pteroptus.
The holotype had been collected from a bat in a cave in Indiana.
Species that it affects include the little brown bat, northern long-eared bat, and riparian myotis.
It has been documented affecting bats in Indiana and Pennsylvania in the United States, Nova Scotia in Canada, and Mato Grosso in Brazil.
