The Cypselosomatidae are a family of true flies (Diptera) closely related to the Micropezidae. Eleven living genera and one fossil genus are described, 8 of which are in the subfamily Pseudopomyzinae; this group was formerly ranked as a family, but they have been treated as a subfamily of Cypselosomatidae since 2007. Some species are believed to be associated with bat guano.
