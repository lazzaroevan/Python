The Spanish toothcarp (Aphanius iberus), also known as the Spanish pupfish or Iberian killifish, is a small, endemic species of fish in the family Cyprinodontidae. Its risk of extinction is one of the greatest of any Iberian vertebrate. Its limited range, coupled with the drastic population decline the species has suffered in the last two decades, has caused it to be placed on endangered species lists, both in Spain and internationally. Its conservation status in the south of the Iberian peninsula has notably worsened.
A similar fish in the peninsula's south-east has been classified as an independent species, Aphanius baeticus. Aphanius saourensis is another similar species in Algeria.
