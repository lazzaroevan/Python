Crambus lathoniellus is a species of moth of the family Crambidae described by Johann Leopold Theodor Friedrich Zincken in 1817. It is found in Europe, Central and South-East Asia.
The wingspan is about 20 millimetres (0.79 in). In this Crambus a white longitudinal stripe emanates From the wing base ending sharply at an obliquely running dark line. In some specimens a white spot is formed in continuation and up to the submarginal line. The longitudinal strip has behind the center (seen from the base), closer to the submarginal line a "tooth" facing outwards and to the inner edge.
The moth flies from May to September depending on the location.
The larvae feed on various grasses.
