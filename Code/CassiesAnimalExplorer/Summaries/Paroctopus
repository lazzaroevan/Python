Their gills have 6â€‘8 lamellae per outer demibranch.  Paroctopus lays small to medium-sized eggs which are on very short stalks and are attached singly in small clusters within the empty shells of gastropods and bivalves. They are uniformly coloured with little variation in pattern and they lack a patch and groove system. There is a faint frontal white spot complex. The integument lacks large primary papillae.The species of Paroctopus are distributed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean off Mexico and the Gulf of California and in the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.
