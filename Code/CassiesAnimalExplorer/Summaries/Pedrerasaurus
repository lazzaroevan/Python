Pedrerasaurus is an extinct genus of scincogekkonomorph lizard from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) La Pedrera de RÃºbies Formation of Spain. The type species is P. latifrontalis. It is similar in appearance to Meyasaurus, a widespread Early Cretaceous lizard that is also known from the Iberian Peninsula. Both genera have bicuspid (two-cusped) teeth, but unlike Meyasaurus, Pedrerasaurus has frontal bones that are not fused or constricted.
