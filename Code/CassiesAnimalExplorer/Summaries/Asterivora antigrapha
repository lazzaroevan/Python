Asterivora antigrapha is a moth in the family Choreutidae. It is endemic to New Zealand.The wingspan is 10â€“11 mm. The head and thorax are dark fuscous irrorated (speckled) with white. The antennae are dark fuscous dotted with white. The abdomen is dark fuscous, with a series of white scales on the segmental margins. The dark fuscous forewings are suboblong, moderate, the costa gently arched, the apex obtuse, the termen nearly straight and oblique. There is a basal patch and two irregular rather curved shades of purplish-white irroration almost wholly occupying the anterior half of the wing, the last running from a small white spot before the middle of the costa to the middle of the dorsum. There is also a small transverse-linear pale golden-metallic mark on the end of the cell. The dark fuscous hindwings are ovate-triangular, the termen is slightly rounded.
