Shelley's crimsonwing Cryptospiza shelleyi is a vulnerable species of estrildid finch found in Burundi, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and western Uganda in Africa. It has shown population decline over the past few decades, with a current population estimate of 2,500â€“9,999. This is possibly related to uncontrolled deforestation.
