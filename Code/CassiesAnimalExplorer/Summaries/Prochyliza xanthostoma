The waltzing fly (Prochyliza xanthostoma) is a species of "carrion-feeding" cheese skippers, insects in the family Piophilidae and the order Diptera. P. xanthostoma is a member of the genus Prochyliza, which contains eleven species. The adult flies are found through North America and are brown-bodied, with orange and black coloring.  Mating occurs on animal carcasses and male perform mating rituals; females engage in ejaculate feeding.  The waltzing fly is known for its exaggerated sexual dimorphism and has thus become a prominent model for sexual dimorphism and larval behavior. These organisms are known as cheese skippers because when startled, the larvae (which often infest cured meats and cheese) can leap several inches into the air. P. xanthostoma is an important model organism for sexual selection, larval behavior, and adult reproductive success and survivability.
