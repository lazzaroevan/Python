The forewings are pale bronzy-fuscous with the costa narrowly white from the base to beyond the middle and with a strong white longitudinal streak from the base above the middle to four-fifths of the costa, the upper edge projecting to touch the costal streak before and beyond the middle, otherwise edged with blackish-fuscous, the lower edge margined with blackish-fuscous suffusion on the posterior half. There is a blackish-fuscous streak along the fold from the base almost to the tornus and a moderate cloudy white subdorsal streak from the dorsum near the base to the tornus, as well as a white subterminal streak from above the tornus to the apex, connected with the termen by two fine branches margined with blackish-fuscous dashes.
