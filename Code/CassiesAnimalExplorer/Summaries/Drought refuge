A drought refuge is a site that provides permanent fresh water or moist conditions for plants and animals, acting as a refuge habitat when surrounding areas are affected by drought and allowing ecosystems and core species populations to survive until the drought breaks.  Drought refuges are important for conserving ecosystems in places where the effects of climatic variability are exacerbated by human activities.
