The speckle-chested piculet (Picumnus steindachneri) is a species of bird in the family Picidae (woodpeckers) endemic to Peru. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland and montane forests. It is threatened by habitat destruction as the forests are cleared to make way for agricultural land, and the IUCN has rated it as being an endangered species.
