Pseudoeurycea lineola, commonly known as the Veracruz worm salamander or Mexican slender salamander, is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental near Cuautlapan, in the east-central  Veracruz, Mexico, at elevations of 800–1,250 m (2,620–4,100 ft) above sea level. Molecular evidence suggests that it consists of two distinct species. It was the type species of genus Lineatriton.
