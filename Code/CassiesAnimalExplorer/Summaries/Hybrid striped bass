A hybrid striped bass, also known as a wiper or whiterock bass, is a hybrid between the striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and the white bass (M. chrysops).  It can be distinguished from the striped bass by broken rather than solid horizontal stripes on the body. Hybrid striped bass are considered better suited for culture in ponds than either parent species because they are more resilient to extremes of temperature and to low dissolved oxygen.
They became part of aquaculture in the United States in the late 1980s. Most producers purchase the fish young (as fry or fingerlings) and raise them in freshwater ponds. Currently, about 10 million lb (4.5 million kg) are produced annually in the United States. Hybrid striped bass are used both as a gamefish and a food fish.
Hybrid striped bass are produced two different ways. Some of these fish are produced by fertilizing eggs from white bass with sperm from striped bass; the resulting fish are also called "sunshine bass" or "Cherokee bass". Others are produced by fertilizing eggs from striped bass with sperm from white bass; the resulting fish is called a "palmetto bass".
Hybrid striped bass are known for aggressive feeding habits which makes them highly sought-after by anglers.  Often schooling by the thousands, these stocked fish surface feed on baitfish such as shad.  Often called "breaking", this surface feeding makes the fish visible and easy to catch on a wide array of lures and baits.  Popular lures include casting spoons, buck-tail jigs, soft-body plastic fish replicas, and inline spinners.
Their quality as a hard-fighting gamefish is closely followed by their delicious firm, white, flaky meat.  Many restaurants sell "striped bass" on their menus, but these are farm-raised hybrid striped bass.
