Donacia is a large genus of aquatic leaf beetles in the subfamily Donaciinae. Like other members of that subfamily, the beetles have long antennae. They are active and able to fly. Larvae feed on submerged portions of aquatic plants, such as water lilies, and breathe oxygen from plant vessels. Adults live on surface parts of the same plants.
