Cyphorhinus is a genus of birds in the family Troglodytidae. Established by Jean Cabanis in 1844, it contains the following species:
Song wren (Cyphorhinus phaeocephalus)
Chestnut-breasted wren (Cyphorhinus thoracicus)
Musician wren (Cyphorhinus arada)The name Cyphorhinus is a combination of the Greek words kuphos, meaning "hump" or "hunch" and rhis or rhinos, meaning "nose" (or, in this case, bill). It has been emended from the earlier incarnation Cyphorhina.
