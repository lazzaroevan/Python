The Sri Lankan relict ant (Aneuretus simoni) is a species of evolutionarily ancient ant placed in a tribe of its own within the family Formicidae. The genus is monotypic, with the only species endemic to Sri Lanka, where it is known from just a few locations. It is one of the few ant species considered endangered.
