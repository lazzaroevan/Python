Coloraderpeton is an extinct genus of a√Østopod lepospondyl within the family Oestocephalidae. Coloraderpeton is known from the Carboniferous Sangre de Cristo Formation of Colorado, and was initially known from vertebrae, ribs, and scales recovered from a UCLA field expedition in 1966. Peter Paul Vaughn described these remains in 1969. A skull was later reported in an unpublished 1983 thesis and formally described by Jason S. Anderson in 2003.
