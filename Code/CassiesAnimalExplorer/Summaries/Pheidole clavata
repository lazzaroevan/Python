Pheidole clavata is a species of ant in the genus Pheidole. Pheidole clavata inhabits Eastern and Northern Africa. This species of Pheidole, like many others, are dimorphic, which means that a colony may contain one or several queens. Each colony is made up of two castes: the "minor" workers, and the "major" workers, or "soldiers".  The majors have large heads that they use as both weapons and tools to cut open large prey for the colony. The latter generally have enormous heads and mandibles in comparison to their usually fairly modest body size.
