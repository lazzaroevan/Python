The Philippine long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis philippensis) is a subspecies of the crab-eating macaque, known in various Philippine languages as matching/matsing or the more general term unggoy ("monkey"). It is endemic to the Philippine forests and woodlands, but especially in the mangrove forests of western central Philippinesâ€” particularly in Palawan, the Visayas, and Mindanao. The names M. f. philippinensis or even M. f. philippinenesis have also been used, but arise from orthographical error.
