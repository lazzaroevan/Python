The magnificent sunbird (Aethopyga magnifica) is a species of bird in the sunbird family which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time.  It is endemic to the western Philippines and was once considered a subspecies of the crimson sunbird.
