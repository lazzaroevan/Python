Conus ruthae is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.These snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" human by means of a small harpoon-like venomous stinger extruded through the shell opening. 
The threat by snails to humans is limited as the primary habitat of the snails is in deeper waters (20-100m), so contact with humans other than divers is minimized.
