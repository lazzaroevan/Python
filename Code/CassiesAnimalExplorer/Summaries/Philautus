Philautus is a genus of shrub frogs in the family Rhacophoridae from Asia. Some species in this genus are now considered extinct by IUCN, while others are widespread and abundant (such as the recently described P. abundus, which was specifically named for this fact). The taxonomy of the group is unclear, with many poorly described species.This genus is unique in that development not direct, with all growth inside the egg and no free-swimming tadpole stage. Some species have been found to bury their eggs in soil, although they are arboreal, and others attach their eggs to leaves.
