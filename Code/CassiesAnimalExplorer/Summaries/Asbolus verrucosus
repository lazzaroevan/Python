Asbolus verrucosus, also known as the desert ironclad beetle or blue death feigning beetle, is a species of darkling beetle native to the deserts of the Southwestern United States, mainly the Sonoran desert. It is highly adaptable to hot environments and feeds on fruit, dead insects, and sometimes even plant matter. This beetle has been known to feign death when threatened. They are increasingly becoming popular in the pet trade, due to their ease of care, hardiness, and longevity.
