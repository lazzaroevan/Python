Sonorella neglecta is a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helminthoglyptidae. Sonorella is a genus of large land snails consisting of over 80 species, with new ones continuing to be described. The shells typically differ only rather subtly, but proportions of the genitalia differentiate species. The genus is distributed in the southwestern USA (Arizona, New Mexico and NW Texas) and northern Mexico, with individual species often restricted to a single mountain massif ("sky island") or to a small part of one. Sonorella neglecta is such a narrow-range endemic from the Chiricahua Mountains. Its official vernacular name is the Portal Talussnail.
