The leafbirds (Chloropseidae) are a family of small passerine bird species found in the Indian Subcontinent  and Southeast Asia. They were formerly grouped with the ioras and fairy-bluebirds in the family Irenidae. As presently defined, the leafbird family is monogeneric, with all species placed in the genus Chloropsis.
