The Cylindrotomidae or long-bodied craneflies are a family of crane flies. About 115 species in 9 genera occur worldwide.
Most recent classifications place the group to family level. this was not supported by recent phylogenetic analyses by Petersen et al. however
Zhang et al. have overturned this with their phylogenetic analyses.  Thus they remain an established family.
