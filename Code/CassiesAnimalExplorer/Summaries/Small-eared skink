The small-eared skink (Oligosoma stenotis) is found only on Stewart Island/Rakiura, New Zealand. It was first described in 1994 by Geoff Patterson and Charles Daugherty. It is a moderately small (80 mm snout to vent) skink, that lives in one of the most inhospitable (to lizards) environments on earth.
