Plum Leaf Miner (Stigmella slingerlandella) is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in North America from Ontario, New York, Michigan and Ohio, possibly south to Florida.
The wingspan is 3.5â€“5 mm.
The larvae feed on Prunus species, including Prunus nigra and Prunus serotina species. They mine the leaves of their host plant.  The larva first eats a narrow linear mine, then widens the mine so as to produce an irregular, more or less ovate blotch. Three to twelve mines are often found on a single leaf. When full grown the larva leaves the mine through a cut in the upper surface of the leaf, falls to the ground, and there constructs a small flattened brownish cocoon in cracks in the soil, under loose stones, or between the base of the tree and the surrounding soil.
