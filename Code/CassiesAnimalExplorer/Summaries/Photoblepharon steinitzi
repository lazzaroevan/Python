The flashlight fish (Photoblepharon steinitzi) is a species of saltwater anomalopid fish of the order Beryciformes. It is native to the western Indian Ocean and the Red Sea where it is found near coral reefs. It is small at only 11.0 cm (4.3 in) in length, and relatively stout compared to other members of its family. It has a mostly solid black body, with the exception of white discoloration around its pectoral fins and a lateral line of reflective scales. It is most notable for the bioluminescent organs located underneath its eyes, which it uses to find prey, evade predators, and communicate with other members of its species. Like other Beryciformes, its reproduction is oviparous. It has little or no commercial value, and this combined with its timid, nocturnal nature makes population sizes and trends unknown. As such, it is listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
