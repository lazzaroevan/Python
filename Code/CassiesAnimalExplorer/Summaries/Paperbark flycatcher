The paperbark flycatcher (Myiagra nana), also known as the little restless flycatcher, is a passerine bird in the family Monarchidae. It occurs in tropical woodland and riverine habitats of northern Australia and southern New Guinea. Previously, some authorities lumped the paperbark flycatcher as a distinctive subspecies of the restless flycatcher (Myiagra inquieta) of southern and eastern Australia, with which it forms a superspecies.
