Sphex jamaicensis is a species of thread-waisted wasp in the family Sphecidae.ITIS Taxonomic notes:

Sphex jamaicensis (Drury, 1773) (originally in Vespa) is apparently a senior secondary homonym of Sphex jamaicensis Fabricius, 1775 (though these two have apparently never been treated as congeneric).
