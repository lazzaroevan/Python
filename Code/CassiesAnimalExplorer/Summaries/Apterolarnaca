Apterolarnaca is a genus of Orthopterans, sometimes known as 'leaf-folding crickets' in the subfamily Gryllacridinae, tribe Ametrini and genus group Apotrechae Cadena-Casta√±eda, 2019.  Records of occurrence are from southern China and Vietnam.The prefix "Aptero-" means that these Orthopterans are similar to the genus  Larnaca, but have secondarily evolved without wings (becoming apterous).  There are a number of similar genera, described from Vietnam by AV Gorochov, and the Orthoptera Species File indicates that other locality records and possibly other species have yet to be discovered in the Indo-China region.
