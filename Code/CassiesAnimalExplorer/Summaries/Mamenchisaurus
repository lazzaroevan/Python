Mamenchisaurus ( mah-MUN-chi-SAWR-É™s,[1] or spelling pronunciation ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur known for their remarkably long necks which made up nearly half the total body length. Numerous species have been assigned to the genus; however, many of these might be questionable. Fossils have been found in the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan Province in China. Several species are from the Upper Shaximiao Formation whose geologic age is uncertain. However, evidence suggests that this be no earlier than the Oxfordian stage of the Late Jurassic. M. sinocanadorum dates to the Oxfordian stage (158.7 - 161.2 mya) and M.anyuensis to the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous ~114.4 mya. Most species were medium to large size sauropods 15 to 26 meters (49 to 85 ft) in length. Two as yet undescribed cervical vertebrae, which might belong to M. sinocanadorum, suggest one of the largest dinosaurs known; estimated at 35 metres (115 ft) in length and possibly weighed 60 and 80 tonnes (66 and 88 short tons).
