It is the first member of the Steleopteridae family, to be found living during the Cretaceous period, to be described, and belongs to the genus Steleopteron. There is a sister taxon – Steleopteron deichmuelleri.The discovery of the species showed that the family Steleopteridae had not died out by the Cretaceous period. These damselflies were fast insectivorous predators.The species name refers to the fact that the species existed in the Cretaceous period.
