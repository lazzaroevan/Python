The firefinches (Lagonosticta) are a genus of African birds in the family Estrildidae.
The genus Lagonosticta was introduced by the German ornithologists Jean Cabanis in 1851. The type species was subsequently designated as the African firefinch. The name combines the Ancient Greek words lag≈çn "flank" and stiktos "spotted".
