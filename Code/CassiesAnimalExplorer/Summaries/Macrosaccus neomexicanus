Macrosaccus neomexicanus is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from the south-western United States in the states of Arizona and New Mexico.
The length of the forewings is 2.7â€“3.5 mm.
The larvae feed on Robinia neomexicana. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine begins as a relatively short, serpentine track which enlarges to an elongate-oval, whitish blotch located on the underside of the leaflet. As the larva develops and begins laying down silk, the mine becomes strongly tentiform, causing the upper surface to roll over.
