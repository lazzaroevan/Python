The Peruvian small-eared shrew (Cryptotis peruviensis) is a species of mammal in the family Soricidae. It is known only from northern Peru, where it has been found in shrubby "elfin" cloud forest in the Andes at elevations from 2050 to 3150 m. The species may also be present in Ecuador. It has the southernmost range of any shrew in South America. (The restricted range of shrews in South America is a reflection of their limited mobility and relatively recent arrival from Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.)
