Stictophaula is a genus of Asian Tettigoniidae (bush crickets or katydids) of the tribe Holochlorini within the subfamily Phaneropterinae. They are found in Indo-China, China, and Malesia.The genus was originally erected in 1922 by Morgan Hebard in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The genus Stictophaula is most closely related to Phaula (now Phaulula), also in the tribe Holochlorini, differentiated by wing morphology including the shape of the veins, the male tergites, and female ovipositors.
