Cynarctoides is an extinct genus of the Borophaginae subfamily of canids native to North America. It lived from the Early Oligocene to the Middle Miocene, 33.3â€”13.6 Mya, existing for approximately 19.7 million years. Seven species are currently recognised, all of which are estimated to have weighed no more than 1 kilogram (2.2 lb). They had an unusual dentition that implies an omnivorous, or possibly even herbivorous, diet.
