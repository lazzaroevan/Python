The pale-winged trumpeter (Psophia leucoptera), also known as the white-winged trumpeter, is a species of bird in the family Psophiidae. It is found in the southwestern Amazon rainforest of Brazil, northern Bolivia, and eastern Peru.
It has two subspecies: The widespread nominate has a white rump and is found south of the Amazon River and west of the Madeira River, while ochroptera has a yellowish rump and is found between the Amazon River and the lower Rio Negro. Genetic evidence suggests the closest relative of ochroptera is the grey-winged trumpeter, leading some to treat it as a separate species, the ochre-winged trumpeter (P. ochroptera).The reproductive behavior of the nominate subspecies of the pale-winged trumpeter is the best known of all the trumpeters'.  Groups of adults defend a territory together.  Several males mate with the dominant female, the dominant male doing so most often.  She lays an average of three eggs in a hole in a tree, where both males and females incubate.  The young hatch covered with thick, dark, cryptically patterned down.  Soon afterwards, they jump down to the ground and follow the adults. Their call is a loud staccato trumpeting.
