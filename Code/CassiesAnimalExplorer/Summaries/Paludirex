Paludirex (meaning "swamp king") is an extinct genus of mekosuchine crocodylians from the Pliocene and Pleistocene of Australia. Remains of this animal have been found in the Riversleigh lagerstätte of northwestern Queensland. It was a medium-sized crocodile, estimated to grow up to 4 metres in length. It had large, conical teeth with serrations and an extremely broad snout, features that probably allowed it to specialise in ambushing prey in shallow water.Two species are known: the type species Paludirex vincenti, named by Jorgo Ristevski and colleagues in 2020, and P. gracilis, originally named by Paul Willis and Ralph Molnar in 1997 and transferred to the genus by Ristevski and colleagues. Both originally belonged to the genus Pallimnarchus (meaning "ruler of all the swamps"), named by Charles Walter De Vis in 1886 based on fragmentary material mineralised by apatite belonging to multiple species. While part of this material was subsequently selected as the lectotype, much of it has been lost, and Ristevski and colleagues considered it to lack distinguishing features. They declared Pallimnarchus and its type species Pallimnarchus pollens dubious names; Paludirex vincenti is based on a more complete skull measuring 65 centimetres (26 in) long, "Geoff Vincent’s specimen", which was formerly assigned to P. pollens. The species is named for Geoff Vincent, who made the original discovery of the specimen in Chinchilla, Queensland.
