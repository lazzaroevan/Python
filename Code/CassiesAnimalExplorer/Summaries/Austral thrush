The austral thrush (Turdus falcklandii) is a medium-sized thrush from southern South America. There are two subspecies, the Magellan thrush (T. f. magellanicus) from south Argentina and south and central Chile, and the Falkland thrush (T. f. falcklandii) from the Falkland Islands.

The austral thrush is similar to the European blackbird, also of the genus Turdus, with a yellow bill and feet, a dark brown head, back and wings and paler underparts. The smaller T. f. magellanicus is more olive below, while in  T. f. falcklandii the underside tends towards ochre. Both subspecies have streaked throats.
In Chile and Argentina the austral thrush lives in a variety of habitats from Nothofagus forests to agricultural lands and even gardens. On the Falkland Islands it makes use of human altered habitat as well but is most numerous in tussac grasses near beaches.
