Parribacus japonicus, the Japanese mitten lobster, is a species of slipper lobster. The Japanese name zōri-ebi (ゾウリエビ) refers to the zōri, a type of Japanese sandal, which it resembles in appearance. It lives in shallow water, up to 20 metres (66 ft) deep, around the southern coasts of Japan, from Maizuru and Tokyo Bay to the Ryūkyū Islands. It grows up to 16 centimetres (6.3 in) in total length, and is occasionally fished and sold for its meat.
