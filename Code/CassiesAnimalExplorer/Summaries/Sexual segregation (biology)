In biology, sexual segregation is the differential use of space, habitats, and resources by males and females, or the separation of males and females into different social groups outside the breeding season. Sexual segregation is widespread among animals, especially among vertebrates that live in groups, and has also been observed in plants. It was first formally proposed by Charles Darwin in his book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.
