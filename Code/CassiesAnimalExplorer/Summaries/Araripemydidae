Araripemydidae is a family of turtles belonging to the order Testudines. There are no living representatives of the family but fossil records have been used to identify it as part of the Pleurodira suborder. There are five collections of single fossils, four that were found in Brazil and one that was found in Niger. The family contains two recognised genera, Araripemys and Laganemys, and two species, Araripemys barretoi and Laganemys tenerensis. Fossils indicate they lived from the Late Cretaceous period (100mya) to the Paleocene period (55mya).
