Pseudopostega lobata is a moth of the family Opostegidae. It was described by Donald R. Davis and Jonas R. Stonis, 2007. It is probably a common, widespread neotropical species, now reported in Central America from Belize to Costa Rica, with two records from northern Argentina.
The length of the forewings is 2â€“2.4 mm. In Central America, adults have been recorded over much of the year from January to August and October, with only November reported for Argentina.
