Leiolopisma mauritiana, Didosaurus maurtianus, is a large (the largest known), extinct species of skink (family Scincidae). It was found only in Mauritius, but became extinct around 1600 probably due to introduced predators.

It may have been somewhat fossorial in nature.  This is speculative and based on a reconstruction. The Mauritian giant skink, became extinct by 1650. Only a semi - complete specimen is known in addition to some odd bones. (Supposedly, a former director of the Mauritian Institute threw away specimens including some bones of this species). The remaining skeleton is missing the feet and digits, thus making it impossible for a SENI biometric analysis per se (Schnirel. 2004). The semi - complete skeleton does have a skull shaped similar to a blue-tongue skink (Genus: Tiliqua). The restoration undertaken by the (Species in Bronze Project), if accurate, gives a SENI value of .06 which would indicate that this species could have been fossorial or saxicolous in lifestyle. This is further linked by the fact that the closest living relative of this species (as mentioned by the restorers) is the Round Island skink: Leiolopisma telfeirii. The Round Island skink also gives a SENI value of .06. The Round Island skink is a species capable of caudal autotomy. This skink is often seen darting in the underbrush or between rocks.
An undescribed extinct Leiolopisma from RÃ©union was closely related, whereas the Round Island skink is a more distantly related surviving species from Mauritius. (Austin & Arnold 2006)
