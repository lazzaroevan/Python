Ascocotyle angrense is a fluke in the genus Ascocotyle that mainly infects birds. It has previously been confused with A. diminuta, which infects fish-eating birds and raccoons. It has also been recorded from the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in a saltwater marsh at Cedar Key, Florida, where it occurred in 25% of animals.
