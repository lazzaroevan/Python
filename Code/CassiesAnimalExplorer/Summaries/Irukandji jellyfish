The Irukandji jellyfish ( IRR-É™-KAN-jee) are any of several similar, extremely venomous species of box jellyfish. With a very small adult size of about a cubic centimetre (1 cm3), they are both the smallest and one of the most venomous jellyfish in the world. They inhabit the northern marine waters of Australia. They are able to fire their stingers into their victim, causing symptoms collectively known as Irukandji syndrome. Irukandji Syndrome can be deadly. There are about 16 known species of Irukandji, of which Carukia barnesi, Malo kingi, Malo maxima, Malo filipina and Malo bella are the best-known.The symptoms of Irukandji syndrome were first documented by Hugo Flecker in 1952. They were named after the Irukandji people, whose country stretches along the coastal strip north of Cairns, Queensland. The first of these jellyfish, Carukia barnesi, was identified in 1964 by Jack Barnes; to prove it was the cause of Irukandji syndrome, he captured the tiny jellyfish and allowed it to sting him, his nine-year-old son and a robust young lifeguard. They all became seriously ill, but survived. Australian toxinologist Jamie Seymour made a documentary about the jellyfish called 'Killer Jellyfish'.In 2015, North Queensland researchers discovered evidence that Irukandji jellyfish actively hunt prey.
