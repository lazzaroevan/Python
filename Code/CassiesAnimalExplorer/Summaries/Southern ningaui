Southern ningaui  refers to Ningaui yvonneae, a tiny marsupial carnivore related to the Dasyuridae family. Similar in appearance to Ningaui ridei, found throughout central Australia, this species occurs in spinifex on semi-arid sandplains across the southern coast of the continent. The fur is a tawny or greyish olive colour, light grey below, and distinguished by shades of cinnamon. Ningaui yvonneae prefers smaller prey, including insects and spiders, but capable of killing and consuming larger animals such as cockroaches and skinks. Their narrow muzzle is used with quick and fierce bites about the head to despatch their meal. The species description was published in 1983, unknown until the closer examination of the genus Ningaui established in 1975.
