Hurleyella is a genus of small flies in the family Dolichopodidae from the Nearctic and Neotropical realms. They belong to the "micro-dolichopodids", a group of probably unrelated genera from the New World which have a body length of 1 mm or less. The subfamily placement of this genus is currently uncertain, though in some aspects the genus fits into Medeterinae. The genus is named after the late dipterist Richard Hurley.
