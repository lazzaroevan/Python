Compsolechia molybdina is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Walsingham in 1910. It is found in Mexico (Guerrero).The wingspan is about 14 mm. The forewings are shining, purplish grey, with an inwardly diffused transverse fascia on the outer third, angulated outward about its middle and bounded along its outer edge by an indistinct narrow pale line, beyond which, after a slight purplish shade, the remainder of the wing to the apex is slaty grey, rather paler than the basal part. Around the termen and around the depressed obtusely angulated apex runs a blackish line at the base of the pale slaty grey cilia. The hindwings are brown.
