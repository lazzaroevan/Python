Ardeadoris cruenta is a species of very colourful sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Chromodorididae. Its name is derived from the feminine form of the Latin word cruentus, which means "stained with blood" and is a reference to the red spots on its upper dorsum. It was transferred to the genus Ardeadoris on the basis of DNA evidence.
