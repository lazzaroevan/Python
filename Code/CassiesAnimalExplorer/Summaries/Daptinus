Daptinus is an extinct genus of ichthyodectid fishes within the subfamily Saurodontinae, from the Late Cretaceous (Coniacian-Campanian) Niobrara Formation of Alabama, that was originally named as a species of Saurocephalus (S. phlebotomus) in 1870 by Edward Drinker Cope, but was moved to a separate genus in 1873. Subsequent authors listed Daptinus as a tentative, possible synonym of Saurocephalus. The holotype, which is probably the only known specimen discovered to date, is listed as containing vertebrae (?) and portions of the cranium, the latter including the dentary, maxilla and palate.
