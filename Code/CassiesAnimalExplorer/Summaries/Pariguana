Pariguana (meaning "near Iguana" in Greek) is an extinct genus of iguanid lizard from the Late Cretaceous of western North America. It is known from a single type species, Pariguana lancensis, named in 2012 on the basis of a partial lower jaw from the Lance Formation in eastern Wyoming. This jaw bone comes from a layer dated approximately 650,000 years before the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. Pariguana is the oldest definitive iguanid from North America, and may represent the first stage of the iguanian evolutionary radiation from Asia into North America.
