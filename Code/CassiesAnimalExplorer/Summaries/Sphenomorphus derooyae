Sphenomorphus derooyae  is a species of skink. It is found in New Guinea and in the Bismarck Archipelago, including Admiralty Islands, New Britain, and New Ireland. It might be a species complex, and the proper name for populations outside New Guinean mainland is uncertain. This species is named for Dutch zoologist Nelly de Rooij (then spelled "de Rooy").
