The spider genus Sosippus is, with other genera in the subfamily Hippasinae, unique among the spiders in the family Lycosidae in producing a large funnel-web resembling that of the Agelenidae. The posterior spinnerets are more elongate than in other wolf spiders.

Their eyes are arranged in three rows, with four small eyes in the anterior (lowest), two large eyes in the second, and two smaller lateral eyes in the third row.
Sosippus is found from Central America to the southern United States.
The closest relatives are found in the genus Aglaoctenus.
The species of Sosippus seem to have diverged relatively recently in geologic time.
