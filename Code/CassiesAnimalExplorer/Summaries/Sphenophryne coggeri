Sphenophryne coggeri is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is endemic to New Guinea and known from two regions in Papua New Guinea, one in the Madang Province and the other in the Southern Highlands Province (the intervening areas have seen little survey work). The specific name coggeri honors Harold Cogger, a herpetologist from the Australian Museum.
