Cuninidae is a family of hydrozoans in the order Narcomedusae. They have dome-shaped bells and tentacles set above the undulating margin of the bell. Their gastric pouches contain the gonads situated in line with the tentacles, the number of pouches being the same as the number of tentacles. The pouches do not extend below the points of origin of the primary tentacles. Members of some genera have a peripheral canal system and others do not. No radial canals or secondary tentacles are present.
