Patu digua is a very small species of spider. The male holotype and female paratype were collected from Rio Digua, near Queremal, Valle del Cauca in Colombia.By some accounts it is the smallest spider in the world, as males reach a body size of only about 0.37 mm - roughly one fifth the size of the head of a pin. However, there are other spider species of similar size where only the female is known; and male spiders are generally smaller.
