Cossina is the name for both a section and subsection of Ditrysian insects in the order containing both butterflies and moths having a dorsal heart vessel. The section named Cossina contains two subsections: one also named Cossina (containing mostly smaller moths in the superfamilies Castnioidea, Cossoidea and Tortricoidea) having pupae with dorsal spines; and subsection Bombycina (containing generally larger sized moths and butterflies in the superfamilies Bombycoidea, Calliduloidea, Cimelioidea, Drepanoidea, Geometroidea, Noctuoidea, Papilionoidea and Uranioidea) having spineless pupae.
