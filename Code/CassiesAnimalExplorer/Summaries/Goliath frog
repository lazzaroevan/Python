The goliath frog otherwise known as goliath bullfrog or giant slippery frog (Conraua goliath) is the largest living frog. Specimens can grow up to 32 centimetres (13 in) in length from snout to vent, and weigh up to 3.25 kilograms (7.2 lb). This species has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction and its collection for food and the pet trade.
