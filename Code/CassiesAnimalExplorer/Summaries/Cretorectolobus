Cretorectolobus is an extinct carpet shark. It was described by G.R. Case in 1978, and the type species is C. olsoni, which existed during the Campanian in Canada and the United States. Another species, C. gracilis, was described by Charlie J. Underwood and Mitchell in 1999, from the Hauterivian to Barremian strata of the Speeton Clay Formation of England. The species epithet refers to the shark's teeth, which Underwood and Mitchell described as gracile and narrow in form. A new species, C. robustus, was described from the Cenomanian of Canada by Underwood and Stephen L. Cumbaa in 2010.
