Pauloterminus spinodorsalis is an extinct shrimp-like stem group crustacean that lived during the Atdabanian Age of the Early Cambrian (about 520 to 516 million years ago). It is the only species classified under the genus Pauloterminus, which is tentatively classified under the family Waptiidae. Its fossils were recovered from the Lower Cambrian Sirius Passet Lagerst√§tte of the Buen Formation of northern Greenland.It was first described by the paleontologist Rod S. Taylor in 2002. Its generic name is derived from Latin paulus ("small") and terminus ("end"). The specific name is from Latin spina ("thorn") and dorsalis ("of the back").
