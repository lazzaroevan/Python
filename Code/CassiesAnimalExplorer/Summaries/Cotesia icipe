Cotesia icipe is a parasitoid species of wasp of the genus Cotesia. Found in tropical Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, it was first discovered as a parasitoid of the Lepidopterans Spodoptera littoralis and beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua). Therefore it is now being studied as a possible biological control of Lepidopteran pests of Amaranth crops in those areas.
