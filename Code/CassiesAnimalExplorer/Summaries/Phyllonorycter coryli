Phyllonorycter coryli, or nut leaf blister moth, is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is found most of Europe, except the Balkan Peninsula.
The wingspan is 7â€“9 mm. The forewings are golden-ochreous, often fuscous-tinged,
first costal spot dark-margined posteriorly.The larva is pale yellowish ; dorsal line dark green ; head pale brown.The larvae feed on Corylus avellana, Corylus colurna, Corylus maxima and Ostrya carpinifolia. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They create an upper-surface silvery tentiform mine. At first, the mine remains quite flat, and has the appearance of a blotch mine. At the end, the leaf is strongly contracted. There may be several mines in a single leaf. The pupa is made in a cocoon in a corner of the mine. The frass is deposited in the opposite corner.
