A fog desert is a type of desert where fog drip supplies the majority of moisture needed by animal and plant life.Examples of fog deserts include the Atacama Desert of coastal Chile and Peru, the Baja California Desert of Mexico, the Namib Desert in Namibia, the Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert, and Biosphere 2, an artificial closed ecosphere in Arizona.
The Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, features lomas, areas in which fog condenses against mountain slopes near the sea and creates "fog oases" with an abundant biodiversity of plant and animal species.Drastic changes in elevation such as mountain ranges allow for maritime winds to settle in specific geographic areas, which is a common characteristics in fog deserts. The Andes Mountain range is the land form that divides Chile and Peru into inland and coastal regions and allows for the fog desert to form along the Pacific coast. In the Atacama Desert, plant coverage can be as high as 50% in the center fog zone to as low as no life whatsoever above the fog line. Within arid fog deserts with low precipitation levels, fog drip provides the moisture needed for agricultural development. The diverse sections within a fog desert region allow for the growth of a diverse group of plant structures such as succulents, deciduous species, and woody shrub.
