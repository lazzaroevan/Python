Sloane's viperfish, Chauliodus sloani, is a predatory, mesopelagic dragonfish found in deep-pelagic waters across the world. The species was first described by German scientists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider in their 1801 book Systema ichthyologiae: iconibus CX illustratum, volume 1. Its size can range from 64 mm to 260 mm, and it is an iridescent silver-blue color. It has two rows of photophores, one on each side of the ventral part of its body. It is believed that C. sloani adjusts the intensity of ventral photophores during diurnal migrations to camouflage itself from predators that might see its shadow from below.
