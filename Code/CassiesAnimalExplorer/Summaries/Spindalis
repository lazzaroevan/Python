Spindalis is a genus consisting of four non-migratory species of bird. It is the only genus in the family Spindalidae.  The species are endemic to the Greater Antilles; a population on Cozumel Island, off the Yucat√°n Peninsula's east coast, is part of that island's West Indian fauna. The species were traditionally considered aberrant members of the tanager family Thraupidae.
Males are characterized by bright plumage while females are duller and have a different coloration. The nests are cup-shaped.
