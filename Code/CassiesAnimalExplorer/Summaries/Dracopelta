Dracopelta (from Latin draco, dragon and Greek πέλτη, peltē, "small shield") was an ankylosaurian dinosaur from Portugal, described by Peter Galton in 1980. When Galton described the only known specimen, he referred it to the Kimmeridgian age (Late Jurassic) of the locality of Ribomar. However, to complicate matters, there are two localities nearby called Ribomar in the Estremadura region of Portugal. The first, near Mafra, is dated as Early Cretaceous, and the second, the Farta Pao Formation near Lourinhã, as Late Jurassic. Antunes and Mateus (2003), considered the Late Jurassic age to be more likely.
The type species was designated D. zbyszewskii, in honour of palaeontologist Georges Zbyszewski.
