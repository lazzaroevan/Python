Cynarctus is an extinct genus of  the Borophaginae subfamily of canids native to North America. It lived during the Middle to Late Miocene 16.0â€”10.3 mya, existing for approximately 5.7 million years. Fossils have been uncovered in California, Maryland, western Nebraska, and Texas. It was likely an omnivore, and lacked the bone-cracking adaptations found in some later borophagines.
