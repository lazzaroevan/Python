The false cobra (Malpolon moilensis), or hooded malpolon, is an opisthoglyphous snake found in parts of Africa and the Middle East. The name "false cobra" comes from the fact that while it is not a cobra, it imitates a cobra's stance by spreading its neck into a hood and hissing like the cobra. It can grow up to 1.5 metres in length and preys on rodents and lizards.
