The magenta-throated woodstar (Calliphlox bryantae) is a hummingbird that is a resident breeder in forest edge and scrub of the  Talamancan montane forests.
The 9 cm (3.5 in) long, 3.5 g (0.12 oz) male magenta-throated woodstar is unmistakable with its magenta throat separated by a white collar from the green chest and flanks. The back is green and the belly is rufous. There are white rump patches, and the black-tipped tail is long and forked.
The female is 3 cm (1.2 in) long and lacks the male's long tail. Her plumage is generally like the male's but her throat is grey-buff instead of magenta, and the tail sides are rufous. Immature birds are like the female, but paler below and with buff fringes to the upperparts plumage.
The male gives a diving display flight alone or in loose groups. His song is a spluttering gurgle, and the call a dry chi or territorial chrrrrt.
These birds usually visit flowers of herbs, trees and scrubs for nectar, cocking their tails as they feed.
Its nest is undescribed.
