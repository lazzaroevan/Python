Lobophora halterata, the seraphim, is a moth of the family Geometridae. It was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1767. The species can be found in central and northern Europe and a few localities in southern Europe, Siberia, Amur, Primorye, Sakhalin and Japan.

The wingspan is 20–25 mm. The length of the forewings is 12–15 mm. Forewing whitish, with a very slight tinge of brown, at least in the central area; a narrow subbasal dark band, closely followed by conspicuous broader one, the pale line which separates them angulated anteriorly; the lines of the median area ill-defined, dentate. Hindwing white, nearly always with a narrow greyer distal border and sometimes with one or two indistinct lines in outer half. Forewing beneath very weakly but more uniformly marked; hindwing with very distinct discal dot. Variable in the intensity of the markings.The moths fly from May to June.[1]The larvae feed on aspen and poplar.
