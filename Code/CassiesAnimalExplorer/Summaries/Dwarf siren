Dwarf sirens are eel-like salamanders of the genus Pseudobranchus.  Dwarf sirens possess external gills throughout adulthood and lack hind legs.  Dwarf sirens can be distinguished from members of the genus Siren in that dwarf sirens have three toes on each foot rather than four.  Like sirens, dwarf sirens are restricted to the Southeastern United States.
