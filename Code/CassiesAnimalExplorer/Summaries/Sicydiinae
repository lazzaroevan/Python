The Sicydiinae are a small subfamily (about 118 species) of freshwater gobies, with only nine genera. They are usually found in fast-moving mountain streams in tropical islands. They are characterized by highly developed rounded suction discs and an amphidromous lifecycle. Adult lengths range from 2 to 15 cm (0.79 to 5.91 in). Some species are popular in the aquarium trade. The genera included under Sicydiinae are:
