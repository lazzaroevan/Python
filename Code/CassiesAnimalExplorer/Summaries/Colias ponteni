Colias ponteni is a butterfly in the  family Pieridae.
Colias ponteni was described from the Sandwich Islands (supposedly Hawaii) and Colias imperialis from Port Famine (Strait of Magellan in Chile), although there is serious doubt about these locations.
Currently though, this species does not exist either in Hawaii or Patagonia. It is only known from the type series, consisting of 11 specimens (now 150 years old), and is thought to be extinct.
All of the specimens are in two museums in London and Stockholm.
