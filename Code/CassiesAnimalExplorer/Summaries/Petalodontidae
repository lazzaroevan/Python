Petalodontidae is an extinct family of marine cartilaginous fish related to modern day chimaera found in what is now the United States of America and Europe. With a very few exceptions, they are known entirely from teeth.  All fossils range from the Carboniferous to the Permian, where they are presumed to have died out during the Permian/Triassic extinction event.
