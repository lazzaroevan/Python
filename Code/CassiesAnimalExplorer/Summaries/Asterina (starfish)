Asterina is a genus of asteroideans in the family Asterinidae.
The species occurring in Australian waters are considered to not be congeneric with the type species A. gibbosa (Pennant, 1777) by Rowe and Gates (1995), and will possibly to assigned to another genus or a new genus. Rowe and Gates (1995) also suggested that Asterina should be restricted to Atlantic waters.
