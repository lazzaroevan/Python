Curetis acuta, the angled sunbeam, is a species of butterfly belong to the lycaenid family. It is found in Indomalayan realm. Curetis acuta is sexually dimorphic due to the different dorsal coloration of the wings between the sexes, however their ventral wings are similar and of silver color which reflects sunlight. The reflection of light by silver ventral wings plays a role of signalling during flight, camouflage while at rest or during hibernation, and lowering body temperatures by reflecting the sunlight.
