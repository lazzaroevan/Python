A feral animal or plant (from Latin: fera, 'a wild beast') is one that lives in the wild but is descended from domesticated specimens.
As with an introduced species, the introduction of feral animals or plants to non-native regions may disrupt ecosystems and has, in some cases, contributed to extinction of indigenous species.  The removal of feral species is a major focus of island restoration.
