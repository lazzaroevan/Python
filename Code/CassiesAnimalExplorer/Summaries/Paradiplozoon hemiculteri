Paradiplozoon hemiculteri is a species of monogenean of the family Diplozoidae. As in all species of this family, the bodies of the two hermaphroditic members of a couple are permanently fused for life. 

This monogenean is a parasite of the gills of the sharpbelly Hemiculter leucisculus in China. According to Jirsov√° et al., P. hemiculteri is the only diplozoid found on the gills of H. leucisculus to date.
