Coleotichus blackburniae is a species of insect in the family Scutelleridae, the jewel bugs. It is commonly known as the Koa bug or the Koa shield bug. It has been dubbed the stinkless stink bug for its lack of the malodorous defensive chemicals present in other heteropterans. It is Hawaii's largest endemic true bug.
