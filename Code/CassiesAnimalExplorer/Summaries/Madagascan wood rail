The Madagascan wood rail (Mentocrex kioloides), also known as the kioloides rail, is a species of bird in the family Sarothruridae. It is endemic to forests, often in wet areas, in northern and eastern Madagascar. The Madagascan wood rail is a secretive and shy species, often showing elusive behavior, such as running away from the slightest disturbances. This has contributed to a lack of study on this species; a reason why it is not that well known.This species was formerly placed in the genus Canirallus together with Tsingy wood rail and the grey-throated rail. A molecular genetic study published in 2019 found that the grey-throated rail is not closely related to the wood rails. The wood rails were therefore moved to the resurrected genus Mentocrex.
