A cusp is a pointed, projecting, or elevated feature. In animals, it is usually used to refer to raised points on the crowns of teeth. The concept is also used with regard to the valve between the right atrium and the right ventricle in the human heart. This valve is closed during ventricular contraction by the tricuspid valve, so named because it usually consists of three cusps or leaflets.
