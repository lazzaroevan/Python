Conus planiliratus is an extinct species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.This species is not to be confounded with Conus planiliratus Sowerby, G.B. III, 1870, a synonym of Graphiconus inscriptus inscriptus maculospira (Pilsbry, H.A. & C.W. Johnson, 1922), itself a synonym of Conus inscriptus Reeve, 1843.
