The steely-vented hummingbird (Saucerottia saucerottei) is a medium-sized hummingbird that is a resident breeder from  Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. The Central American birds differ in voice and behaviour from those in South America and may be a separate species, the blue-vented hummingbird (S. hoffmanni).
