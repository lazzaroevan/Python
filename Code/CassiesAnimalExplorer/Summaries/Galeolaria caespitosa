Galeolaria caespitosa is a worm of the family Serpulidae, casually referred to as Sydney coral when found in dense aggregations. It is an Australian inter-tidal tube worm which lives within a hard tube like shell, which prevents desiccation at high tide. Black feathery gills emerge when it is underwater for it to filter feed on plankton.
