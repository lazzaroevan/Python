Hyainailouros is an extinct genus of hyaenodont mammal of the family Hyainailouridae that lived during the Miocene, of which there were at least three species spread across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Closely related to other large African creodonts such as Simbakubwa and Megistotherium, Hyainailouros walked with a semi-digitigrade stance and was probably capable of large, leaping bounds.

Alongside its African relatives and the last members of the genus Hyaenodon from Asia, Hyainailouros was among the largest creodonts that existed.
