Skunks are North and South American mammals in the family Mephitidae. While related to polecats and other members of the weasel family, skunks have as their closest Old World relatives the stink badgers. The animals are known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong, unpleasant scent. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown, cream or ginger colored, but all have warning coloration.
