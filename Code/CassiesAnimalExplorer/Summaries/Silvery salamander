The silvery salamander (Ambystoma platineum or LJJ) was once considered a distinct species of mole salamander from the United States of America and Canada. It is usually between 5.5 – 7.75 in (12 – 19.9 cm) long and is slender with many small silvery-blue spots on its back and sides. It is brownish grey and the area around its vent is grey. This unisexual Ambystoma hybrid species, has been grouped with other unisexual ambystomatids that takes genetic material from Jefferson salamander (A. jeffersonianum), streamside salamander (A. barbouri), small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum), tiger salamander (A. tigrinum) and the blue-spotted salamander (A. laterale).
"Species name designations for unisexual Ambystoma are no longer in use". Instead, unisexual Ambystoma are now considered distinct biotypes rather than species.
