Proterochampsa is a genus of proterochampsid archosauromorph from the Late Triassic (Carnian) Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin in northwestern Argentina and the Alemoa Member of the Santa Maria Formation in the Paraná Basin in southeastern Brazil. It normally measured about 1.8 to 2 m (5.9 to 6.6 ft), though P. barrionuevoi, known from a 44 centimetres (17 in) skull, could have grown up to 3.5 m (11 ft).
