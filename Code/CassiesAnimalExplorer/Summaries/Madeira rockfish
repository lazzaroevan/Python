The Madeira rockfish (Scorpaena maderensis) is a species of scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) in the genus Scorpaena, found in the coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. This species reaches a length of around 14 centimetres (5.5 in) SL. The species was described by Achille Valenciennes in 1833 after a specimen from Madeira. Although S. maderensis is well represented in the areas that it is found, many key aspects of its biology are still unknown.
