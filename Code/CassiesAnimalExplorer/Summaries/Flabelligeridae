Flabelligeridae is a family of polychaete worms, known as the 'cage worms', notable for their cephalic cage: the chaetae of the first chaetigers form a fan-like arrangement surrounding the eversible head.Mazopherusa is a possible fossil example from the Carboniferous; other fossil material is only dubiously assigned to the family.
