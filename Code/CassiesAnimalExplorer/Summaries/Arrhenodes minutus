Arrhenodes minutus, commonly known as the oak timberworm, is a species of primitive weevil in the family Brentidae (Order: Coleoptera). These beetles are pests of hardwoods in North America. Adult oak timberworms are shiny, elongate, and range 7 to 25 mm in length (Solomon, 1995). They are reddish-brown to brownish-black in coloration, with yellow spots on their elytra. Adults display strong sexual dimorphism; females have long, slender, straight mouthparts, while males possess flattened, broadened mouthparts with large mandibles. Males are known to be aggressive and use these large mandibles for combat (Sanborne, 1983). These mandibles are also used in courtship (Garcia-C., 1989). Larvae are elongate, cylindrical, white, and curved. They have 3 pairs of jointed legs on the thorax and 1 pair of prolegs near the end of the abdomen (Bragard et al., 2019).
