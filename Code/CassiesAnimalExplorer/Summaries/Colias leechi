Colias leechi is a very little known butterfly in the family Pieridae. It was described from the East Palearctic  "In ramificationibus occidentalibus montium Himalayensium in valle Chonging" (17,000 feet (5,200 m) altitude).Chongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. None are high enough to fit the description and RÃ¶ber gives Sikkim as the locality and the British Museum card gives the type locality as West Himalaya Ladak.
