Fushanosaurus (meaning "Fushan lizard") is a genus of basal titanosauriform dinosaur from the Shishugou Formation from Xinjiang Province in China. The type and only species is Fushanosaurus qitaiensis.  It is solely known from the holotype specimen (FH000101), which consists of a complete right femur. Using "Huanghetitan" ruyangensis and Daxiatitan as a basis, Fushanosaurus was estimated to have been approximately 30 metres (98 ft) long, which would then make it one of the longest known dinosaurs. It was published in the journal Global Geology.
