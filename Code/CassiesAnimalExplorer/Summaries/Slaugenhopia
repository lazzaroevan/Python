Slaugenhopia is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian temnospondyl within the family Tupilakosauridae. Fossils have been found from the Early Permian San Angelo Formation in Texas. The type and only species, S. texensis, was named in 1962. It may be closely related to the dvinosaur Kourerpeton. Slaugenhopia was once classified as a trimerorhachid but is now classified as a tupilakosaurid.
