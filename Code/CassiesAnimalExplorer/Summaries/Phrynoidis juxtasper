Phrynoidis juxtasper, also known as the giant river toad or Borneo river toad, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is found in Borneo (Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia) and Sumatra (Indonesia) below 1,600 m (5,200 ft) asl. Prior to its species description, it was confused with Phrynoidis asper (hence the specific name juxtasper, from Latin juxta- meaning "near to").
