Homunculus patagonicus is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in Argentina (Santa Cruz Formation) during the Miocene. It is likely the ancestral species for the subfamily Pitheciinae, whose living members include the sakis, bearded sakis, and the uakaris.Killikaike is an extinct genus of New World monkey. The genus includes one species, Killikaike blakei, that lived in Argentina during the Early Miocene.Killikaike blakei was collected in southernmost Argentina in January, 2005 and the type specimen consists of a remarkably well preserved face.  Unfortunately the neurocranium is not present. The specimen was named for the locality where it was found Killik Aike Norte, on the estate of the Blake family.Perry et al. (2014) considered K. blakei to be a junior synonym of Homunculus patagonicus.
