A felid hybrid is any of a number of hybrid between various species of the cat family, Felidae.  This article deals with hybrids between the species of the subfamily Felinae (feline hybrids).
For hybrids between two species of the genus Panthera (lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards), see Panthera hybrid.  There are no known hybrids between Neofelis (the clouded leopard) and other genera.  By contrast, many genera of Felinae are interfertile with each other, though few hybridize under natural conditions, and not all combinations are likely to be viable (e.g. between the tiny rusty-spotted cat and the leopard-sized cougar).
