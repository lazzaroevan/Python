Aulatornoceratinae is one of three subfamilies of the gonititid family Tornoceratidae, an extinct order of Paleozoic ammonoid cephalopods. Aulotornoceratinae was established as a subfamily by R.T.Becker, 1993, initially for Aulatornoceras, named by Schindewolf, 1922. Subsequently four other genera have been added.
Members (genera) of the Aulotornoceratinae are known from the Late/Upper Devonian of Western Australia and Alsace, France. In France their fossils are found in well bedded pelagic (deep ocean) limy mudstones, Frasnian in age, with a paleolatatude of about 32째 south. Current latitude is 43.4째 N.  In Western Australia, in Canning Basin, they are found in Frasnian and Famennian, (Upper Devonian), marginal slope and basinal facies related to reef complexes. Paleolatitudes are about 20째 S. Current latitude is 18.0째 S.
Shells of the type genus Aulatornoceras are involute, widely to narrowly umbilicate, with strongly biconvex growth lines. The suture is goniatitic.
