Australothyris is an extinct genus of basal procolophonomorph parareptile known from the Middle Permian (middle Capitanian stage) of Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone, South Africa. The type and only known species is Australothyris smithi. As the most basal member of Procolophonomorpha, Australothyris helped to contextualize the origin of this major parareptile subgroup. It has been used to support the hypotheses that procolophonomorphs originated in Gondwana and ancestrally possess temporal fenestrae, due to its large and fully enclosed temporal fenestra and South African heritage. It also possessed several unique features, including a high tooth number, long postfrontal, small interpterygoid vacuity, and a specialized interaction between the stapes and quadrate.
