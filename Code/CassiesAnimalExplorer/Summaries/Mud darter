The mud darter (Etheostoma asprigene) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish, a darter from the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. It is endemic to the lowlands of the Mississippi River basin from Wisconsin and Minnesota south to Louisiana and East Texas. It is also found in the drainages of the Sabine and Neches Rivers of Texas and Louisiana.  It can be found in slow-moving waters on riffles in rivers, as well as in creeks, swamps, lakes, and reservoirs.  It mostly consumes the larvae of midges and blackflies.  This species can reach a length of 7.1 cm (2.8 in), though most only reach a length of 5 cm (2.0 in).
