Corbicula fluminalis is a species of freshwater clam, an aquatic bivalve mollusk in the family Cyrenidae. This species is distinct from, but often confused with, the rather similar species Corbicula fluminea. Even though both species are native to Asia, they are both present as introduced species in the United States and Europe, and they are both commonly known as "Asian clams".
