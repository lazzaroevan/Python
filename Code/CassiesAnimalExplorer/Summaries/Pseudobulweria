Pseudobulweria is a genus of seabirds in the family Procellariidae. They have long been retained with the gadfly petrel genus Pterodroma despite morphological differences. Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b sequence analysis has confirmed the split out of Pterodroma and places the genus closer to shearwaters. They thus represent either a plesiomorphic lineage still sharing some traits of the ancestral Procellariidae with the gadfly petrels, or convergent evolution of a shearwater to the ecological niche of gadfly petrels.They are a poorly known,and highly endangered group: 3 of the 4 extant species are listed by the IUCN as critically endangered.  The Tahiti petrel (Pseudobulweria rostrata) is the most familiar and the best studied.
