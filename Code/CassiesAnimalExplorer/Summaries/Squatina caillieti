The Philippines angelshark (Squatina caillieti) is a species of angelshark, family Squatinidae, known only from a 33 cm (13 in) long immature female caught in the Philippines, where it is the only known representative of its family. It has a flattened body and head with greatly expanded pectoral and pelvic fins, and is greenish above with brown spots. Identifying traits of this species include the spiracles, which are more widely spaced than the eyes and bear papillae (nipple-shaped structures) on the posterior inner rims, and the relative positions of the two dorsal fins. Additionally, S. caillieti lacks fringes on its barbels, enlarged thorns along the middle of its back, and ocelli ("eyespots") on its fins.
