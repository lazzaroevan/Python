Atelopus petersi is a species of toads in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to Ecuador and is known from the Cordillera Oriental in the Napo Province and more provisionally, in the Chimborazo Province. The specific name petersi honors James A. Peters, an American zoologist who collected the first specimens of this species in 1962 and provided a description under the name Atelopus pachydermus. Common names Peters' stubfoot toad and Peters' jambato toad have been coined for it.
