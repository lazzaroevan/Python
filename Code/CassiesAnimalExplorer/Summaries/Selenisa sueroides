Selenisa sueroides, the pale-edged selenisa or legume caterpillar, is an owlet moth in the family Erebidae. The species was first described by Achille Guen√©e in 1852. It is found in North America.The MONA or Hodges number for Selenisa sueroides is 8658.Some systems of Microtubing to help irrigate commercial crops have been compromised, as the larvae of S. sueroides had damaged the pipes in the citrus groves of south Florida. The caterpillars had munched holes in the plastic tubing to penetrate the pipes and then pupate. They seemed to prefer black tubing compared to coloured tubing.
