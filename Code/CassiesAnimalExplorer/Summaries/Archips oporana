Archips oporana is a moth of the family Tortricidae. It is found in Europe, China (Heilongjiang, Liaoning), Korea, Japan and Russia (Primorye).The wingspan is 19–28 millimetres (0.75–1.10 in). The moth flies in two generations from June to October in western Europe.
The larvae feed on Thuja, common juniper, Scots pine and spruce. They tie two sets of twin needles and attach the middle part to the branch of the host plant. A single larva may feed on seven or eight of these sets of needles per day. Pupation takes place in mid-June. The species overwinters as a young larva within a rolled leaf near an axillary bud.
