Attockicetus is an extinct genus of remingtonocetid early whale known from the Middle Eocene (Lutetian) Kuldana Formation in the Kala Chitta Hills, in the Attock District of Punjab, Pakistan.Thewissen & Hussain 2000 described Attockicetus based on fragmentary cranial material.  Their specimen includes a fragmentary rostrum, an endocast (interior of cranium), and an ectotympanic (ear bone).  The specimen also had preserved cheek teeth, P3-M3, which is rare in remingtonocetids.  Attockicetus is primitive in the retention of large protocones on the upper molars and the location of the orbits anteriorly on the skull.  It is probably the most plesiomorphic remingtonocetidCooper, Thewissen & Hussain 2009 collected additional dental material at the type locality which they assigned to Attockicetus.  Compared to pakicetid teeth found at the same locality, the P3 of Attockicetus is much lower, angled anteriorly, and has a very long posterior extension.  A long diastema separates P3 from P4 and P3 is longer than P4, which Cooper et al. identified as a remingtonocetid character and, because Attockicetus is the only known remingtonocetid known from the Kala Chitta Hills, they tentatively assigned the specimen as belonging to this genus.  The P4 of Attockicetus is similar to those of Pakicetus in retaining a tall protoconid (cusp) and anterior and posterior basal extensions with prominent cristae (crests), but differs from them in having steeper protoconid slopes, being taller, and having longer basal extensions.  Cooper et al. also noted that the molar wear in pakicetids is typically extensive, whilst the P4 in Attockicetus is less worn, suggesting that the latter was not used for breaking down food, but for holding prey.
