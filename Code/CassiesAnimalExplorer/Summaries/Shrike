Shrikes () are carnivorous passerine birds of the family Laniidae. The family is composed of 33 species in four genera.
The family name, and that of the largest genus, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as butcherbirds because of their feeding habits. The common English name shrike is from Old English scrÄ«c, alluding to the shrike's shriek-like call.
