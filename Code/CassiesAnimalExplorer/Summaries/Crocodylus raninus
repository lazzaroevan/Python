Crocodylus raninus, the Borneo crocodile, is an enigmatic species of freshwater crocodile endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo. Its taxonomic status is controversial and unclear: it has been considered by some authors as a synonym of Crocodylus porosus, although a redescription in 1990 and 1992 presented evidence of distinct identity.
