Atteva sidereoides is a moth of the Attevidae family. It is endemic to the Dominican Republic.
It is similar Atteva siderea, but with orange and white marks much reduced. It is easily distinguished from A. siderea by the white thorax and by lacking both the distal orange band parallel to termen and the white dots on terga.
