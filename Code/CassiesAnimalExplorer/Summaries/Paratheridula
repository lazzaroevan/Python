The genus was first described by Herbert Walter Levi in 1957, though it has been described under several different names, including Mysmena 4-maculata, Theridion quadrimaculatum, and Theridion arcadicum,It has been found from Florida to southern Chile, with a possible pantropical distribution, and is suspected to have been introduced elsewhere.
