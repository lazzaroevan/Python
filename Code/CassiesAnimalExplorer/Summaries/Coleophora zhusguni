Coleophora zhusguni is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in southern Russia.
The larvae feed on Calligonum leucocladum. They mine the green branches of their host plant. They create a silky case with a straight caudal part and a sharply down-curved anterior end. The case is three-valved, 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in) long and pale chocolate brown. The larvae can be found in the beginning of June and after hibernation from April to May.
