Arctogymnites is a genus of  ammonoid cephalopods from the middle Triassic included in the ceratitid subfamily Beyrichitinae. Related genera include Beyrichites, Frechites, Gymnotoceras, and Salterites
The Treatise Part L, 1957 separates the beyrichitids (Beyrichidae) as an independent family in the Ceratitaceae, separate from the Ceratitidae.  Later (Tozer 1981) they were incorporated into the Ceratitidae as a subfamily.
