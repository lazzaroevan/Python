Bunker's woodrat (Neotoma bryanti bunkeri) is an extinct subspecies of Bryant's woodrat in the family Cricetidae. Only five specimens are known; these were collected in 1932 by W.H. Burt and are housed at a museum at UCLA.  Neotoma bunkeri was only described from Coronados Islands, Baja California, Mexico. It probably died out as a result of depletion of food resources and predation by feral cats.
