Prolistrophorus grassii is a parasitic mite in the genus Prolistrophorus. It was described as Listrophorus grassii (a member of the genus Listrophorus) in 1954 from the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Georgia. In 1974, Fain and Hyland placed it in Prolistrophorus and in 1984, Fain and Lukoschus redescribed the species on the basis of collections from the marsh rice rat in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida and the southern bog lemming (Synaptomys cooperi) in Indiana, West Virginia, and Iowa.
