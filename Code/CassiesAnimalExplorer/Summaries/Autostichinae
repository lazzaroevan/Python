The Autostichinae are a subfamily of moths in the superfamily Gelechioidea. Like their relatives therein, their exact relationships are not yet very well resolved. The present lineage was often included in the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae), but alternatively it is united with the Symmocidae sensu stricto (and often also the Holcopogonidae and/or certain genera otherwise considered twirler moths, e.g. Deoclona and Syringopais) to form an expanded family Autostichidae (in the past also referred to as family Symmocidae).
