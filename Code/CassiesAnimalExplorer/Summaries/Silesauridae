Silesauridae is an extinct family (or clade) of Triassic dinosauriforms. It is most commonly considered to be a clade of non-dinosaur dinosauriforms, and the sister group of dinosaurs. Some studies have instead suggested that most or all silesaurids comprised a paraphyletic grade of early dinosaurs ancestral to traditional ornithischians. Silesaurids have a consistent general body plan, with a fairly long neck and legs and possibly quadrupedal habits. However, they occupied a variety of ecological niches, with early silesaurids (such as Lewisuchus) being carnivorous and later taxa (such as Kwanasaurus) having adaptations for specialized herbivory. As indicated by the contents of referred coprolites, Silesaurus may have been insectivorous, feeding selectively on small beetles and other arthropods.
