Astylosternus perreti (common name: Perret's night frog) is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is endemic to western Cameroon and known from Mount Manengouba and from parts of the Bamileke Highlands, at elevations of 1,200–1,400 m (3,900–4,600 ft) above sea level. It is one of the few species of African frogs to have claws, used on demand, when it feels threatened.
