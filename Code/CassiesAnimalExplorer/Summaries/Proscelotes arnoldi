Proscelotes arnoldi, commonly known as Arnold's skink or Arnold's montane skink, is a species of lizard endemic to Africa. Sometimes called a legless skink, it has tiny reduced limbs. The front limbs are very small, and both fore-limbs and hind-limbs have reduced function and appear to be vestigial attachments for its lifestyle and habitat.
