The slaty brushfinch (Atlapetes schistaceus) is a species of bird in the family Passerellidae. It is found in humid Andean forests from western Venezuela, through Colombia, to Ecuador, with a disjunct population in central Peru. The latter is sometimes considered a separate species, the Taczanowski's brushfinch (A. taczanowskii). Furthermore, the Cuzco brushfinch from south-eastern Peru is sometimes considered a subspecies of the slaty brush finch.
