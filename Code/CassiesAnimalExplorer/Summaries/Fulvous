Fulvous  is a colour, sometimes described as dull orange, brownish-yellow or tawny; it can also be likened to a variation of buff, beige or butterscotch.  As an adjective it is used in the names of many species of birds, and occasionally other animals, to describe their appearance. It is also used as in mycology to describe fungi with greater colour specificity, specifically the pigmentation of the surface cuticle, the broken flesh and the spores en masse.
The first recorded use of fulvous as a colour name in English was in the year 1664. Fulvous in English is derived from the Latin "fulvus", a term that can be recognised in the scientific binomials of several species, and can provide a clue to their colouration.
