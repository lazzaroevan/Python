The paradise riflebird (Lophorina paradisea) is a passerine bird of the family Paradisaeidae. Formerly a member of the genus Ptiloris, it has since been moved to the genus Lophorina alongside other riflebird species. It is found in subtropical, temperate rainforests in eastern Australia. The species is sexually dimorphic; the male is black with iridescent blue-green patches, while the female is gray-brown and white.
The paradise riflebird is frugivorous and insectivorous. During breeding season, males are promiscuous and perform solitary displays for females, which involves moving rapidly from side to side with the head tilted back, showing off the neck plumage.
