Mangelia is a large genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Mangeliidae.The genus has been used for a long time as a wastebasket taxon. There have been many described species, many of which have become synonyms. Among the remaining accepted names a good number are still in doubt and are little known. They are only tentatively placed within the genus Mangelia.
This genus was named Mangelia by Leach and accepted by Risso in 1826. Later, some authors, such as Lov√©n in 1846, spelled it inadvertently as Mangilia, to honor the Italian malacologist Mangili Guiseppe (1767-1829). This had led to some confusion.
