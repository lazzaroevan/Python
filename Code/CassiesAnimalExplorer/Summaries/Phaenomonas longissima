It is a marine, tropical eel which is known from the Atlantic Ocean, including Ascension Island, St. Helena, Brazil, Senegal, Ghana, and Cape Verde. It dwells at a depth range of 25 to 35 metres (82 to 115 ft), and forms burrows in sand and mud sediments on the continental shelf. Males can reach a maximum total length of 50 centimetres (20 in).
