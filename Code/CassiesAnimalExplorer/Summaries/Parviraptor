Parviraptor is a genus of stem-snake (clade Ophidia) containing one species, Parviraptor estesi, from the Late Jurassic (Tithonian) or Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Purbeck Limestone Formation of Dorset, England. A second species, Parviraptor gilmorei, was described from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of Western North America; it was present in stratigraphic zone 4. However, the second species was subsequently transferred to a separate genus Diablophis. An indeterminate species is known from the Bathonian aged Kirtlington Mammal Bed (Kilmaluag Formation, Scotland).
