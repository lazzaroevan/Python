Argiope keyserlingi is a species of orb-web spider found on the east coast of Australia, from central New South Wales to northern Queensland. It is very similar in appearance to a closely related North-Queensland species, Argiope aetherea. A. keyserlingi is commonly found in large populations in suburban parks and gardens, particularly among the leaves of the Lomandra longifolia. Like many species of orb-web spider, A. keyserlingi shows considerable sexual size dimorphism, as the females are many times larger than the males. Mature females can be seen during the summer months and it is not uncommon to see multiple males on the web of one female.
A. keyserlingi is commonly known as the St. Andrew's cross spider, due to the construction of bands of silk forming the arms of an X-shaped cross, similar to the one upon which St. Andrew is traditionally said to have been crucified. Juveniles of this species sometimes build a spiral-shaped pattern of silk. Referred to as web decorations or stabilimenta, these bands are thought to increase the species' prey capture rate - however, in other species, they have been found to protect the spider against predators.
A. keyserlingi is an important model species in studies of spider ecology and behaviour. Using this species scientists have investigated sperm competition, sexual size dimorphism, cryptic female choice, the role of pheromones in mating behaviour and the function and evolution of web decorations.
Its main predators in Sydney are mantids and birds.This type of orb-weaver is cathemeral.
