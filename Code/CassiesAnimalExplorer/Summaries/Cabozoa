In the classification of eukaryotes (living organisms with a cell nucleus), Cabozoa was a taxon proposed by Cavalier-Smith.It was a putative clade comprising the Rhizaria and Excavata.  More recent research tends to place the Rhizaria with the Alveolata and heterokonts instead of the Excavata, however.
