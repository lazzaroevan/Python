Spheniscus muizoni is an extinct species of banded penguins that lived during the early Late Miocene in what is now Peru, South America. The species, the earliest member of the extant genus, was described in 2007 by Ursula B. GÃ¶hlich based on fossils found in the fossiliferous Pisco Formation of the Pisco Basin, southwestern Peru.
