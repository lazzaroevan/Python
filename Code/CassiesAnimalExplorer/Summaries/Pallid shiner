The pallid shiner (Hybopsis amnis) is a small freshwater minnow in the family Cyprinidae. Its synonym is Notropis amnis. They are native to North America and can be found in the Mississippi watershed. The pallid shiner is considered a rare fish in its northern distribution but not in its southern distribution. The pallid shiner was first discovered in the early 1900s in the St. Croix river north of Taylor Falls, and its population has been declining since. Little is known about their feeding and reproductive habits.
