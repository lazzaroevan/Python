Sericornis is a genus of small, mainly insectivorous birds, the scrubwrens in the family Acanthizidae. Despite the similarity in shape and habits, the true wrens (Troglodytidae) are a quite unrelated group of passerines.
The genus previously contained additional species but following the publication of a molecular phylogenetic study of the scrubwrens in 2018, several species were moved to the resurrected genus Aethomyias and the yellow-throated scrubwren was placed in its own monotypic genus Neosericornis.The genus contains eight species:
Large-billed scrubwren, Sericornis magnirostris
Tropical scrubwren or Beccari's scrubwren, Sericornis beccarii - sometimes included in S. magnirostris
Large scrubwren, Sericornis nouhuysi
Spotted scrubwren, Sericornis maculatus - previously included in S. frontalis
Tasmanian scrubwren or brown scrubwren, Sericornis humilis - previously included in S. frontalis
Atherton scrubwren, Sericornis keri
White-browed scrubwren, Sericornis frontalis
Perplexing scrubwren, Sericornis virgatus
