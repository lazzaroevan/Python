Pseudobarbus is a ray-finned fish genus in the family Cyprinidae. The type species is Burchell's Redfin (P. burchelli). The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek pseudes ("false") and the Latin word barbus ("beard", in reference to the barbels of barbs). This genus contains some (and might contain all) of the South African redfins. It was originally proposed as a subgenus but has since been found worthy of recognition as a full genus.
This genus is restricted to southern Africa; all of its species were formerly placed in Barbus, the genus of typical  barbels and their relatives. One taxon was originally described as P. leonhardi â€“ this, however, was a European fish for which the genus was erroneously proposed anew. It has since turned out to be nothing other than the barbel B. peloponnesius.
