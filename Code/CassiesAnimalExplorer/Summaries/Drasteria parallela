The ground color of the wing from the base to the antemedial line and subterminal areas is dark brown with tan and lead-gray mottling. The medial area is light tan, darker near costa, and the terminal area is whitish gray to gray medially and blue gray to brown gray at the margin, with a dark gray to black spot at the apex.
