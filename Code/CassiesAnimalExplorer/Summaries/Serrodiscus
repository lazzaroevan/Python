Serrodiscus Richter and Richter 1941. is a genus of Eodiscinid trilobite belonging to the family Weymouthiidae Kobayashi T. (1943), Order Agnostida (Salter 1864). It lived during the late Lower Cambrian, with remains found in Canada (Newfoundland & Nova Scotia), China (Gansu), The United Kingdom (England), Germany (Silesia), Poland (Holy Cross Mountains), the Russian Federation (Tuva, Gorno-Altayskaya, Kuznetsk Alatau), and the United States (Massachusetts, New York State).  It is named for the spines on the ventral side of the pygidium, which give it a serrated impression.
Fletcher & Theokritoff (2008)  designated Shaw’s (1950, pl. 79, fig. 24)  specimen of “ Weymouthia nobilis (Ford, 1872)”  as the holotype of a new species, Serrodiscus weymouthioides, and considered Runcinodiscus Rushton (in Bassett et al., 1976)  [= ?Weymouthia nobilis (Ford, 1872)] to be a junior synonym of Serrodiscus. Weymouthia and Runcinodiscus Rushton (in Bassett et al., 1976) had previously been viewed as closely allied with Serrodiscus (e.g, Rushton op. cit., 1976).
