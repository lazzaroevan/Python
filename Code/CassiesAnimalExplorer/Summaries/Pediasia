Pediasia is a genus of small moths in the family Crambidae. They are widespread across temperate Eurasia and adjacent regions.Despite this genus being proposed as early as 1825, it was not widely recognized until the mid-20th century. Consequently, most species were initially placed in the closely related genus Crambus.
