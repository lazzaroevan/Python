Hose's broadbill (Calyptomena hosii) is a species of bird in the family Calyptomenidae. It was named after zoologist Charles Hose. It is endemic to highland forests in northern Borneo. It is threatened by habitat loss. It has a blue belly, but otherwise it resembles the other members of the genus Calyptomena.
The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the British colonial administrator, zoologist and ethnologist Charles Hose.
