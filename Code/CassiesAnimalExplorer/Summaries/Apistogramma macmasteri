Apistogramma macmasteri is a dwarf cichlid in the tribe Geophagini, one of the tribes of the subfamily of American cichlids, the Cichlinae. It is a freshwater fish that lives in the Meta River system, a part of the Orinoco basin in Colombia. They grow up to 7 centimetres (2.8 in) in total length.Fish keepers have selectively bred variants with brighter colors than those found in the wild. It is possible that some of these are crossbred with Apistogramma viejita.The author, Sven O. Kullander honoured the cichlid aquarist Mark McMaster with the specific name of this species. McMaster had pointed this species out to Kullander in 1973, when only aquarium specimens were available.
