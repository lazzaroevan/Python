Soleichthys heterorhinos is a sole from the Eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a length of 18 cm.Soleichthys heterorhinos exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when illuminated by blue or ultraviolet light, it re-emits it as red, and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage.
