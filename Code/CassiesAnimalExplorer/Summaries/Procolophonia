The Procolophonia are a suborder of herbivorous reptiles that lived from the Middle Permian till the end of the Triassic period.  They were originally included as a suborder of the Cotylosauria (later renamed Captorhinida Carroll 1988)  but are now considered a clade of Parareptilia.  They are closely related to other generally lizard-like Permian reptiles such as the Millerettidae, Bolosauridae, Acleistorhinidae, and  Lanthanosuchidae, all of which are included under the Anapsida or "Parareptiles" (as opposed to the Eureptilia).
