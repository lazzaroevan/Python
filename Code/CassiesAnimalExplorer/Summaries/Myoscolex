Myoscolex is an early animal species known from the Cambrian Emu Bay Shale in South Australia. Originally interpreted as an annelid, it seems to be an arthropod; the possible presence of an Opabinia-like proboscis, eyes, and flaps suggests a plausible relationship with that species. Myoscolex is the earliest known example of phosphotized muscle tissue, and as to which shows distinct annulation.
