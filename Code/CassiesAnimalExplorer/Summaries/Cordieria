Cordieria is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Borsoniidae.This genus is considered by the French malacologist Maurice Cossmann separate from Borsonia, not on the basis of the columellar plaits alone, but mostly because of the shorter siphonal canal and a number of other characteristics that he enumerates.
