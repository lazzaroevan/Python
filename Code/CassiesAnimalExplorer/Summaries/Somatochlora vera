Somatochlora vera is a species of dragonfly in the family Corduliidae. It was described in 1914 by Aleksandr Bartenev based on a specimen from Ussuri, Siberia. The status of the taxon is unclear. Although currently treated as a separate species by the World Odonata List, it has also been treated as a subspecies of Somatochlora metallica, or as a synonym of Somatochlora exuberata. In addition to Russia, it has also been recorded in northern China.
