Shireplitis is a genus of braconid wasps native to New Zealand. Individuals range from 1.8 to 2.4 mm in body length. Five of the six known species occur on South Island, and one on the North Island. The genus name derives from the Shire, fictional home of the hobbits in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, and five species are named after hobbits, with one species named after Tolkien himself.
