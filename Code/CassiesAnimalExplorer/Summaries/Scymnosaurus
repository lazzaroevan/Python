Scymnosaurus is now considered a nomen dubium.
Scymnosaurus (σκύμνος skymnos = lion cub + σαῦρος, sauros = lizard) is an extinct genus of therocephalian therapsids,  first described by Robert Broom in 1903. There are three species that still take the name Scymnosaurus, S. Ferox, S. Watsoni and S. Major, with a fourth, S. Warreni, now identified as Moschorhinus Warreni. Each of these have now been reclassified into Lycosuchidae incertae sedis.Scymnosaurs are estimated to have been approximately the size of the modern day hyena, and possess teeth suggesting that they were carnivorous. S. Ferox was initially described as the second largest Therocephalian to Titanosaurus, until the discovery of S. Major, which is likely the largest Therocephalian.It is notable that throughout the 19th century, Broom was involved with the work done with Therocephalians and their classifications, and re-classifications, with paper and book publications ranging from 1903 to 1950.
