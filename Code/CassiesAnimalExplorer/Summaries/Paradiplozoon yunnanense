Paradiplozoon yunnanense is a species of monogenean of the family Diplozoidae. As in all species of this family, the bodies of the two hermaphroditic members of a couple are permanently fused for life. 
This monogenean is a parasite of the gills of the cyprinid Sikukia gudgeri in China, in the Jinghong Basin, a tributary of the Lancong-Mekong River. The species is distinguished from congeners by a combination of morphological and molecular features. The species was described under the name Paradiplozoon yunnanensis but the correct spelling is yunnanense since Paradiplozoon is neuter.
