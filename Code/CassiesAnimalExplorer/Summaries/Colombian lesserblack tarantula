The Colombian lesserblack tarantula (Xenesthis immanis) is a terrestrial bird spider (tarantula) originating from Colombia. It is a relatively large spider with a body length reaching 6â€“7 cm and a length width reaching 19-22 cm. It frequently displays a commensal or mutualistic relationship with the microhylid frog Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata. The relationship described is one where the spider may protect the frog and its eggs from predators while the frog protects the spider's eggs from ants. It has also been observed closely associating with Hamptophryne boliviana, another microhylid.
