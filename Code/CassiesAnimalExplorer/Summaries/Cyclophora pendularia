The wings are greyish, thickly striped with darker grey; the markings similar to those of the birch mocha, but the rings are nearly always reddish or purplish, and the central line is wavy.

In another form of the green coloration, the sides are pinkish with dark-brown oblique stripes; in a third the general colour is pale brown.The moths fly from May to August in two broods the dates depending on the location.
