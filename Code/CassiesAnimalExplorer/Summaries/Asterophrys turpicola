Asterophrys turpicola (common name: New Guinea bush frog) is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is widespread in New Guinea and found in both West Papua (Indonesia) and Papua New Guinea, although it appears to be absent from the eastern half of Papua New Guinea. It also occurs on the island of Yapen, off the north-western coast of New Guinea. The species is known for its aggressive behaviour: it can attack and bite viciously.
