Arctonoe is a genus belonging to the family Polynoidae, worms commonly known as "scale worms". Members of this genus predominantly occur in shallow (50 metres or less) waters of the North-east Pacific Ocean and often live as commensals of other marine invertebrates, frequently echinoderms but sometimes molluscs or other  polychaetes.
