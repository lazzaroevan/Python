Pethia is a genus of small freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae native to South Asia, East Asia(only Pethia stoliczkana recorded)and Mainland Southeast Asia. Some species are commonly seen in the aquarium trade. The name Pethia is derived from the Sinhalese "pethia", a generic word used to describe any of several small species of cyprinid fishes. Most members of this genus were included in Puntius, until it was revised in 2012.
