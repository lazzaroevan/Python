Arrhamphus sclerolepis, the Northern snub-nosed garfish, is a species of halfbeak in the genus Arrhamphus found in coastal waters of the Indo-West Pacific around Papua New Guinea and Australia, and in the freshwaters of adjacent river systems. Considered a good game fish, but of little commercial value either as food or as an aquarium fish. This species is known to anglers in Australia as the snub-nosed gar.  The species is distinguished from most other halfbeaks by the lower jaw being only slightly longer than the upper jaw.
