The locust coqui (Eleutherodactylus locustus) is a species of frog in the family Eleutherodactylidae endemic to Puerto Rico. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. E. locustus has suffered a population decline of more than 80% due to introduced predators and amphibian chytrid disease. Scientists believe amphibian chytrid disease may be exacerbated by climate change - warmer temperatures in dry, moist habitats, causing stress that may lead to greater susceptibility to the disease.
