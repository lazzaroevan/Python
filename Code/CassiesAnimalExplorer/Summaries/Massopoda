The Massopoda  is a clade of sauropodomorph dinosaurs which lived during the Late Triassic to the Late Cretaceous periods. It was named by paleontologist Adam M. Yates of the University of the Witwatersrand in 2007. Massopoda is a stem-based taxon, defined as all animals more closely related to Saltasaurus loricatus than to Plateosaurus engelhardti.The name Massopoda, from Latin  massa 'lump'; from Ancient Greek  πους (pous) 'foot', is also contraction of Massospondylidae and Sauropoda, two disparate taxa in the clade.
