Coleophora derasofasciella is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found in the Alps in Austria, Germany, Italy and Slovenia and also in alpine regions in northern Russia and at one spot in northern Sweden (previously described as Coleophora paeltsaella, Palmqvist & Hellberg, 1999).The wingspan is 12–13 millimetres (0.47–0.51 in). The forewings are scattered with greyish white and brownish scales, the light scales also forming diffuse longitudinal costal and discal streaks. There are also blackish scattered scales, especially towards the apex. The costal fringes are light greyish and the dorsal fringes are more greyish proximally covered with light dorsal wing scales. The underside is dark grey. The hindwings are grey with grey fringes.The larvae feed on Dryas octopetala. They create a tubular silken case which is covered with frass grains on the outside. In the youth case, the frass cover is even and complete, in the full-grown case, the frass lies in lengthwise stripes. The full-grown case is three-valved and about 6.5–12 millimetres (0.26–0.47 in) long. The mouth angle is about 45°. Full-grown larvae can be found in June.
