Parantirrhoea is a monotypic butterfly genus in the family Nymphalidae. Its only species, Parantirrhoea marshalli, the Tranvancore evening brown, is endemic to the Western Ghats of India. James Wood-Mason described this species from the specimens in the collection of G F L Marshall which were collected by Harold S. Ferguson who was director of the State Museum at Trivandrum. Little was known about the species in the wild until a population was discovered in the Periyar Tiger Reserve in 1993. Sightings of both sexes of this butterfly is reported in the southern region of the Western Ghats in 2002 (Kunhikrishnan (2002)). In 2006, larvae were collected from an Etah jungle like habitat in Kallar-Ponmudi valley, a northerly extension of the Ashambu hills of southern Western Ghats. Caterpillars collected were reared in laboratory conditions.
