Atelopus vogli is an extinct species of harlequin frog in the family Bufonidae. It was endemic to Venezuela. It is known from collections in two localities: its type locality, Las Peñas near Hacienda la Trinidad in Aragua, and Montalbán in Carabobo. It was first described as subspecies of Atelopus cruciger. The specific name vogli honours Cornelius Vogl, German priest who was a missionary in Venezuela in 1925–1959. Common name Vogl's harlequin toad has been coined for it.
