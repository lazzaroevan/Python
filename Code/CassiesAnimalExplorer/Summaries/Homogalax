Homogalax (from the Greek "ομογάιαξ") is an extinct genus of tapir-like odd-toed ungulate. It was described on the basis of several fossil finds from the northwest of the USA, whereby the majority of the remains come from the state of Wyoming. The finds date to the Lower Eocene between 56 and 48 million years ago. In general, Homogalax was very small, only reaching the weight of today's peccaries, with a maximum of 15 kg. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the genus to be a basal member of the clade that includes today's rhinoceros and tapirs (collectively called Ceratomorpha). In contrast to these, Homogalax was adapted to fast locomotion.
