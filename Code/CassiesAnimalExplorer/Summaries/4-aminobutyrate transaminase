In enzymology, 4-aminobutyrate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.19), also called GABA transaminase or 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, or GABA-T, is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

4-aminobutanoate + 2-oxoglutarate 
  
    
      
        â‡Œ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   succinate semialdehyde + L-glutamateThus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-aminobutanoate (GABA) and 2-oxoglutarate. The two products are succinate semialdehyde and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-aminobutanoate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways: alanine and aspartate metabolism, glutamate metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
This enzyme is found in prokaryotes, plants, fungi, and animals (including humans). Pigs have often been used when studying how this protein may work in humans.
