Crepidochares colombiae is a moth in the Eriocottidae family. It was described by Davis in 1990. It is found in Colombia.
The length of the forewings is 9-9.5 mm for males and about 11 mm for females. The forewings are pale buff, heavily mottled with dark brown and with three dark brown bands, sometimes coalescing to form a W-shaped pattern. There is a fine reticulate network of dark brown lines and spots scattered between the bands and along the costal margin. The termen is mostly dark brown interrupted with three to four light brown to buff spots. The hindwings are uniform dark grey. Adults have been recorded on wing in May.
