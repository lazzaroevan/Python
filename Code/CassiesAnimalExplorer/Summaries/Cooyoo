Cooyoo is a primitive ichthyodectid found in Lower Cretaceous strata of Queensland, Australia.  As with all other ichthyodectids, it was a predator of smaller fish. It grew up to around 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) long when fully grown. The type species, named in 1987, is C. australis, although Arthur Smith Woodward originally named it as a species of Portheus (now a probable synonym of Xiphactinus) in 1894, which was later amended to Xiphactinus.
