Stephanorhinus is an extinct genus of two-horned rhinoceros native to northern Eurasia and possibly North Africa that lived during the Pliocene to Late Pleistocene. Species of Stephanorhinus were the predominant and often only species of rhinoceros in much of temperate Eurasia, especially Europe, for most of the Pleistocene. Two species of Stephanorhinus, Merck's rhinoceros S. kirchbergensis and the narrow-nosed rhinoceros S. hemitoechus persisted into the last glacial period.
