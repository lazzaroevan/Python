Pasquale Bruno (born 19 June 1962) is an Italian football commentator and former professional footballer who played as a defender. He is remembered for being one of the toughest players in the history of Italian football.Throughout his career, he made a name for himself as an aggressive, physical, and hard-tackling player, with a tendency to commit fouls and pick up cards, often attracting criticism and controversy, and earning the nickname "O' animale" (Neapolitan: the animal), due to his tenacious style of play; in total, he received an Italian record of over fifty days of suspension throughout his career. Bruno played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, in particular Juventus, where he won a Coppa Italia-UEFA Cup double in 1990, and subsequently for the club's inter-city rivals Torino, where he won another Coppa Italia in 1993; he also had stints with Lecce, Como and Fiorentina. Following his time in Italy, he ended his career after spells in Scotland and England with Heart of Midlothian, Wigan Athletic, and Cowdenbeath. He currently works as a football analyst for Italian television.
