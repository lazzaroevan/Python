Mysidopsis is a genus of mysid shrimps in the family Mysidae. The sensitivity of these shrimps to water quality makes them suitable for bioassays. Mysidopsis bahia and Mysidopsis almyra, which are used frequently to test for pesticides and other toxic substances, are now classified as Americamysis bahia and Americamysis almyra.
