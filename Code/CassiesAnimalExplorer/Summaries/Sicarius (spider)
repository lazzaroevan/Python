Sicarius is a genus of recluse spiders that is potentially medically significant to humans. It is one of three genera in its family, all venomous spiders known for a bite that can induce loxoscelism. They live in deserts and arid regions of the Southern Hemisphere, and females use a mixture of sand and silk when producing egg sacs. Most are native to South America, with the exception of Central America's S. rugosus, known primarily for its self-burying behavior.  The name is Latin for assassin.
