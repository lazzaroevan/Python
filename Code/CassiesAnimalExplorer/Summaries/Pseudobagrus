Pseudobagrus is a genus of bagrid catfishes that inhabit streams and rivers throughout East Asia. About half of these species occur in China.The two Coreobagrus species, C. brevicorpus and C. ichikiwai, are both treated in some recent literature as valid in Pseudobagrus. It has been noted that Pelteobagrus may not be monophyletic if species placed in Pseudobagrus and Coreobagrus were excluded. The taxonomy of this genus is unclear and many authorities treat it as a junior synonym of Tachysurus.Pseudobagrus species are small- to mid-sized bagrid catfishes. These fish all have an inferior mouth; narial openings widely separated; four pairs of barbels; top of head covered by skin in most species; two dorsal fin spines; pelvic fin small; and caudal fin emarginate, truncate or round.One fossil species, P. ikiensis Watanabe & Uyeno, is known from the Middle Miocene of Japan.
