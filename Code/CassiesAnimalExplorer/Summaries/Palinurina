Palinurina is an extinct genus of crustaceans, belonging to the decapods. These animals lived between the Lower Jurassic and the Upper Jurassic (about 195 - 150 million years ago) and their fossils can be found in Europe (England and Germany). This crustacean is considered one of the oldest lobsters.
