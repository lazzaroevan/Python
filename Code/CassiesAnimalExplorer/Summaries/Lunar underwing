The lunar underwing (Omphaloscelis lunosa) is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Adrian Hardy Haworth in 1809. It has a scattered distribution in western Europe including Spain, Scandinavia and Algeria.

This is a variable species, the forewings ranging from pale buff to dark brown although the paler forms are generally more common. The forewings are usually marked with two dark stigmata and a black streak near the apex. The hindwings are whitish marked with a dark moon-shaped crescent on the hindwing is partially diagnostic and which gives the moth its English name.
