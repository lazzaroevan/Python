Aphanipathes is a diverse genus of black corals in the family Aphanipathidae, typified by large polypar spines. However, there are some disagreement in the correct taxonomic classification of this genus. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) classifies Aphanipathes as being a genus of the family Aphanipathidae while the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) classifies it as a genus of the family Antipathidae.Most commonly found in subtropic and tropic regions, this genus of coral lives in colonies on the continental slope of the ocean floor or on coral reefs. The colonies exhibit different physical appearances; they can be bushy, fan-shaped or branched like feathers. Most of the Aphanipathes species are found in tropical regions where they thrive and live successfully. They are never found in Arctic or Antarctic regions and are very scarce in temperate areas.
