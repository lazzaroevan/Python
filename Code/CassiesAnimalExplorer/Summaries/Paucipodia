Paucipodia inermis is a lobopod known from the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang lagerstätte. Its gut is puzzling; in some places, it is preserved in three dimensions, infilled with sediment; whereas in others it may be flat.  These cannot result from phosphatisation, which is usually responsible for three-dimensional gut preservation, for the phosphate content of the guts is under 1% – the contents comprise quartz and muscovite.  Its fossils do not suggest it had any sclerites, especially when compared with the related Hallucigenia.
