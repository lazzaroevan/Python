The species of tailorbirds listed below are small birds of the genus  Phyllergates .  They were previously placed in the Old World warbler family Sylviidae. However, recent research suggests they more likely belong in the Cettiidae.They occur in the Old World tropics, principally in Asia.
These warblers are usually brightly colored, with green or grey upperparts and yellow white or grey underparts. They often have chestnut on the head.
Tailorbirds have short rounded wings, short tails, strong legs and long curved bills. The tail is typically held upright, like a wren. They are typically found in open woodland, scrub and gardens.
Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider's web to make a cradle in which the actual grass nest is built.
