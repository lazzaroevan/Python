Phyllonorycter suaveolentis is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is found in the mountains of Corsica.
The larvae feed on Alnus viridis suaveolens. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They create a small, oval, lower-surface tentiform mine between two side veins. There are several folds which are very similar. The frass is deposited in two bands at either side of the cocoon.
