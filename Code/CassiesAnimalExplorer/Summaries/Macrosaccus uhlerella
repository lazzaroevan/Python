Macrosaccus uhlerella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Illinois, Missouri, New York, Colorado and Texas in the United States.The wingspan is 6-6.5 mm.
The larvae feed on Amorpha species (including Amorpha fruticosa) and Robinia species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mature mine is an elongate-oval, whitish blotch located on the underside of the leaf usually near the edge of the leaflet. Eventually, as the mine becomes tentiform, the leaf edge is slightly curled.
