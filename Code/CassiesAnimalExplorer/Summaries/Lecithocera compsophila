Lecithocera compsophila is a moth in the family Lecithoceridae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1911. It is found in Sri Lanka.The wingspan is 13â€“17 mm. The forewings are light ochreous brown or sometimes fuscous, somewhat infuscated or darker suffused posteriorly. There are traces of a white oblique strigula from the costa before the middle, which is sometimes obsolete. The stigmata are faintly darker, the plical rather obliquely beyond the first discal, the second discal forming a transverse mark, but all sometimes quite obsolete. A fine oblique white strigula is found from the costa at three-fourths, where a faint angulated whitish line proceeds to the tornus. There is also a black apical dot, more or less edged with white above and beneath, as well as an interrupted blackish terminal line. The hindwings are fuscous, sometimes paler towards the base.
