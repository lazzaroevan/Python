The five-striped sparrow (Amphispiza quinquestriata) is a medium-sized sparrow.
This passerine bird is primarily found along the eastern Gulf of California region and Pacific region of mainland western Mexico, with a breeding range that extends into the southern tip of the U.S. state of Arizona, the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range containing the Madrean sky islands, of southeastern Arizona, extreme southwestern New Mexico, and northern Sonora.
This species is a regular victim of cowbird nest parasites.
