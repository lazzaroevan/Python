Maratus jactatus (colloquially named sparklemuffin) is a species of the genus Maratus (peacock spiders), an Australian member of the jumping spider family. Maratus Jactatus have the ability to jump lengths up to 50 times their size of about 10mm.  The female has a cryptically colored back, whereas the male has the colorful back. They have been collected only in Wondul Range National Park in southern Queensland.  Like other Maratus spiders, the males of the species engage in a courtship display, during which they extend their median and posterior fringed spinnerets. They also spread the flaps from over their inflated opisthomal plate, revealing unique iridescent blue scales "interrupted by three bold transverse bands of red-orange to orange pigmented scales." A male presents both the extended spinnets and his expanded and inflated opisthoma as he faces the female that he courts. However, depending on the colors of the male, the female may be more likely to go to another male or not be attracted to certain males.
