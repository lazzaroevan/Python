Dorcus is a genus of beetles in the family Lucanidae (stag beetles). Of the 30-odd species, most occur in Asia and India; two are found in southern Europe, and two species are from North America. Previously, specimens with serriform teeth on the mandibles and sable pigment were called Serrognathus whereas specimens with but a singular or multiple bulky notches on the mandibles and lustrous sable pigmentation were called Dorcus. Serrognathus was recently reclassified and merged into the genus Dorcus.
