Periphanes is a monotypic moth genus of the family Noctuidae first described by Jacob HÃ¼bner in 1821. Its only species, Periphanes delphinii, the pease blossom, was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It can be found from Afghanistan and the steppe areas of Central Asia and Anatolia up to the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and north-western Africa.
