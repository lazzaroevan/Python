Cybaeus is a genus of araneomorph spiders in the family Cybaeidae, first described by Ludwig Carl Christian Koch in 1868. It is found in America, Europe, Japan, Korea and China. Females of different species are difficult to distinguish, especially in North America. Images of males that include pedipalps are the easiest to determine species.
