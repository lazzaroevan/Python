Lohuecosuchus (Lo Hueco crocodile) is an extinct genus of crocodyliforms related to the current crocodiles. It lived during the Late Cretaceous (late Campanian to early Maastrichtian) in what is now Spain and southern France. It is a genus closely related to Allodaposuchus, a crocodile that lived in what is now Romania. It was both synchronic and sympatric with another allodaposuchid species, Agaresuchus fontisensis. Fossils of the genus have been recovered from the Villalba de la Sierra Formation at Lo Hueco.
