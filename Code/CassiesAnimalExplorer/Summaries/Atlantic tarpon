The Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) is a ray-finned fish that inhabits coastal waters, estuaries, lagoons, and rivers. It is also known as the silver king. It is found in the Atlantic Ocean, typically in tropical and subtropical regions, though it has been reported as far north as Nova Scotia and the Atlantic coast of southern France, and as far south as Argentina. As with all Elopiformes, it spawns at sea. Its diet includes small fish and crustaceans.The tarpon has a reputation for great aerobatics, attaining astonishing size, and having impressive armored scales. It is poorly received as food, but valued as a game fish.
