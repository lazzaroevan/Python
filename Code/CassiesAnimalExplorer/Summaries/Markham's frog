Markham's frog  (Leiopelma markhami) is one of three extinct New Zealand frog species, the others being the Aurora frog (Leiopelma auroraensis) and Waitomo frog (Leiopelma waitomoensis). Subfossil bones used to describe the species were discovered at Honeycomb Hill Cave, South Island, New Zealand, but it once occurred on both South and North Islands. It is estimated that it grew between 50â€“60 mm from snout to vent and it appears to have been a very robust animal.
