Its genus name means "hidden eyelid", and its species name "intertidal". It is commonly known as the coastal tree skink.
Cryptoblepharus litoralis is around 55 mm snout to vent, and dark-brown to black in colour with white to beige spots. The lower surface of the feet are shiny black. Cryptoblepharus plagiocephalus is a very similar species, but has brownish lower surfaces on the feet.
