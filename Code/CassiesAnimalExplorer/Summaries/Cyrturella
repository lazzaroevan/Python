Cyrturella is a genus of flies in the family Dolichopodidae.
The genus was created by Octave Parent in 1938 for the species Micromorphus albosetosus, and was originally given the name Cyrtura. This name for the genus was already in use by the extinct stem-turtle genus Cyrtura, so Parent's genus was renamed to Cyrturella by James Edward Collin in 1952.
