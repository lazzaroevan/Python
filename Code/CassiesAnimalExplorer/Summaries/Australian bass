The Australian bass (Macquaria novemaculeata) is a small to medium-sized, primarily freshwater (but estuarine spawning) species of fish found in coastal rivers and streams along the east coast of Australia. It is a member of the family Percichthyidae and the genus Macquaria (although some researchers place it in the genus Percalates instead). Australian bass is an important member of the native fish assemblages found in east coast river systems. It is a predatory native fish and an extremely popular angling species. The species was simply called perch in most coastal rivers where it was caught until the 1960s, when the name Australian bass started to gain popularity.
