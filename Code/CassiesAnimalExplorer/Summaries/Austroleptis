Austroleptis is a genus of snipe flies, and the sole genus in the family Austroleptidae; until 2010, it was placed in the family Rhagionidae. They are small to moderately sized flies of around 3 to 7.7 mm.
The family Austroleptidae was originally created by Nagatomi (1982) as "Austroleptinae", a subfamily of Rhagionidae. It was later proposed that it be raised to family rank by Stuckenburg (2001).
