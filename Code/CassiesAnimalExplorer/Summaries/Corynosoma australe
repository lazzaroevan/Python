Corynosoma autrale is a species of acanthocephalan (also known as thorny-headed worms, or spiny headed worms). This species usually infects pinnipeds; the semi-aquatic fin-footed marine mammals most commonly known as seals and sea lions. Pinniped infections are not exclusive, recently C. australe has been discovered in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus).
