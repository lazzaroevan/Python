Argiope radon is a species of orb web spider native to Australia. It is found in tropical areas of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland. It is commonly known as the Northern St Andrew's cross spider.Like most orb-weaving spiders, males are much smaller than females. The female grows to around 18 mm in body length while the male is around 6 mm. Females of this species construct web decorations. There were 86 records of Argiope radon listed in Australia as of January 2021. They tend to either form aggregations with spiders of the same species or are found as solitary individuals, and their states heavily impact their web decorating abilities.  Their webs are greatly affected by humidity, but are less affected by temperature changes.
