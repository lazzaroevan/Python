The Spartaeinae are a subfamily of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders). The subfamily was established by Fred R. Wanless in 1984 to include the groups Boetheae, Cocaleae, Lineae, Codeteae and Cyrbeae, which in turn were defined by Eug√®ne Simon.The Spartaeinae are palaeotropical, with an exceptional diversity in the Malaysian and Indonesian archipelagos.They are unusual salticids that are considered basal to the phylogenetic tree of jumping spiders. Like the Lyssomaninae they lack many derived features that the Salticinae possess. Spartaeinae usually have large posterior median eyes. However, these were reduced in the genera Cyrba, Gelotia and Wanlessia.
