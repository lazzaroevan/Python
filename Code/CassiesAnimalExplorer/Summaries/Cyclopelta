Cyclopelta is a genus of Dinidorid bug found in Africa and Asia. There are 14 species in the genus with 8 found in Asia and 6 in Africa. Some species are known to form large aggregation on trees and can cause damage in a few trees of economic importance.
The genus Cyclopelta has a four-segmented antenna. Species in the genus have two to four pairs of conjunctival processes in their aedeagus, a feature shared with Coridius, Colpoproctus and Dinidor. In Cyclopelta the femora are spined along the surface and the females have hind tibiae that are opaque on the inner surface. The underside does not have a series of yellow spots as in Dinidor.
