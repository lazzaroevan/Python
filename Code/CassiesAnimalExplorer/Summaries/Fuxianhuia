Fuxianhuia is a genus of Lower Cambrian fossil arthropod known from the Chengjiang fauna in China.  Its purportedly primitive features have led to its playing a pivotal role in discussions about the euarthropod stem group. Nevertheless, despite being known from many specimens, disputes about its morphology, in particular its head appendages, have made it one of the most controversial of the Chengjiang taxa, and it has been discussed extensively in the context of the arthropod head problem.
The genus is named after Fuxian Lake (Fuxian Hu), where it was unearthed. Its specific name protensa refers to its extended trunk.
