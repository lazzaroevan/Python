The magnificent tree frog (Ranoidea splendida), also known as the splendid tree frog, is a tree frog species first described in 1977. It has a limited range, only occurring on the north-western coast of Australia in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It has a similar appearance to, and can be confused with, the closely related White's tree frog.
