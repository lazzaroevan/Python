Aspidoras depinnai is a relatively recently discovered catfish. It belongs to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It is found in the Ipojuca River basin of Brazil.  It grows to a length of 3.3 cm.  The corydora group of fish is varies massively and as a result many fish are hard to differentiate and define. There are no known procedures to follow for aquaria based breeding, but as with all cordora fish they tend to breed after heavy rainfall or when there is a drop in water temperatures or hardness.
