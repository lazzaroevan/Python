Aristobia reticulator is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It is known from Myanmar, India, China, Laos, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. It feeds on Prunus persica, Liquidambar formosana, Quercus acutissima, Prunus salicina, and Nephelium mutabile. Many references list the name as Aristobia testudo, but this name, though published earlier, is unavailable under the ICZN, primarily in that Johann Eusebius Voet's 1778 work giving the name testudo fails to fulfill the requirement in ICZN Article 11.4 that a work must be consistently binominal; none of Voet's 1778 names, including testudo, are available.
