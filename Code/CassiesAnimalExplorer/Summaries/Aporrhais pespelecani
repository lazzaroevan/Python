Aporrhais pespelecani, common name the "pelican's foot" (or more precisely "common pelican's foot" to distinguish it from congeners), is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Aporrhaidae.
Until the early 20th century the scientific name was usually written with a hyphen and spelled "pes-pelicani". [1]
