The slender white sardine (Escualosa elongata) is a species of sardine (family Clupeidae) in the genus Escualosa. It was described by Thosaporn Wongratana in 1983. It is a tropical fish which was discovered at a Sunday market in Bangkok, Thailand, though the two specimens (holotype: BMNH 1973.1.18.1; paratype: CUB (uncat. 1)) were caught off the eastern coast of the Gulf of Thailand. The sardines are known to swim at a maximum depth of 50 metres. The largest known standard length for the species is 6.7 centimetres (2.64 inches). It is distinguished from its sister species, Escualosa thoracata (the white sardine) by having a more slender body, earning it its common name, and also by a silver band on its flank.
