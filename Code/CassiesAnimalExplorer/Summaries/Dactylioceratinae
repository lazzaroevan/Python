The subfamily Dactylioceratinae comprises early Jurassic ammonite genera that lived during Upper Pliensbachian to Upper Toarcian stage. These dactylioceratids existed from Margaritatus ammonite Zone, when they have evolved from Reynesocoeloceratinae and died out in Variabilis Zone without leaving any descendants.
