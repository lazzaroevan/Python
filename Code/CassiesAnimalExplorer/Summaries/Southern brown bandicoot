The southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) is a short-nosed bandicoot, a type of marsupial, found mostly in southern Australia. A similar species in South Western Australia, known as the quenda (from the Noongar word 'kwinda') was previously thought to be the southern brown bandicoot, but has since been identified as a separate animal and reclassified as Isoodon fusciventer.
