Panulirus brunneiflagellum is a species of spiny lobster that lives around the Ogasawara Group (Bonin Islands) of southern Japan. Its members were previously included in P. japonicus, although it may be more closely related to P. femoristriga. It has been fished for more than 150 years by Japanese fishermen, who call the species aka-ebi. It differs from related species by the lack of banding along the flagella of the first pair of antennae.
