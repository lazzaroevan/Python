Sibynophis bistrigatus, commonly known as GÃ¼nther's many-toothed snake, is a nonvenomous species of colubrid snake found in Myanmar (formerly called Burma) and India (Nicobar Islands), but snakes collected in Myanmar and the Nicobar Islands might actually not refer to the same species. This rare snake is known from tropical dry forests.
