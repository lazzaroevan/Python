Manis paleojavanica, the giant Asian pangolin, is an extinct species of pangolin (genus Manis) native to Asia.In 1926, E. Dubois described the bones of M. paleojavanica discovered in Java. Later, Lord Medway excavated another set of bones at the Niah Caves in Malaysia. In 1960, D. A. Hoojier identified these bones as that of an extinct species. Using carbon dating, the Niah Caves bones were determined to be 42,000â€“47,000 years old.M. paleojavanica is one of the only known fossils to be found nearly complete of the pangolin species, due to their armour-like scales that protected their bodies when they were alive.
