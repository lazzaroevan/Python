The moss millipede (Psammodesmus bryophorus) is a keeled millipede of the family Platyrhacidae native to Colombia. It was described in 2011, and with several species of symbiotic moss found growing on its dorsal surface, it is the first millipede known with epizoic plants.  At least 10 species of bryophytes belonging to families Pilotrichaceae, Lejeuneaceae, Fissidentaceae, Metzgeriaceae and Leucomiaceae have been found to grow on the millipede's dorsum; these plants are believed to camouflage the millipede as its cuticle provides a stable substrate.
