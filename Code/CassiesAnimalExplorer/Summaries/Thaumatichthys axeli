Thaumatichthys axeli is a bottom-dwelling deep-sea anglerfish of the family Thaumatichthyidae. Thaumatichthys axeli lives at a depth of around 3,600 meters (in the abyssal zone), deeper than any other member of the genus Thaumatichthys. As with other members of the family, they possess a distinctive forked light organ inside their mouth, which they use to lure prey. Large, curved teeth "fringe the upper jaw like a comb". Specimens have been founding measuring up to about 50 cm.
