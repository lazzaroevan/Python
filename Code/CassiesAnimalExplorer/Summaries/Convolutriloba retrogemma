Convolutriloba retrogemma is a reddish-brown flatworm 2 mm in length also commonly known as redbug, red planaria, rust flatworm, or simply red flatworm. It is a marine flatworm that gets energy from its endosymbiotic algae or from the consumption of small invertebrates such as copepods and rotifers. Among other flatworms, it is known to starve coral on accident by blocking out its sunlight while searching for food on the corals surface due to its rapid reproduction.C. retrogemma, like many other flatworms, contains dangerous toxins to keep it predators away, and, on death, it can release these toxins. This is harmful to nearby life such as coral and fish, and even people if infected fish are consumed.
