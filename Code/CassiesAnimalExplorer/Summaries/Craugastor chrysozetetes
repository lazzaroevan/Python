Craugastor chrysozetetes is a possibly extinct species of frog in the family Craugastoridae. It is endemic to Honduras where it is only known from near its type locality on the Cerro BÃºfalo, Cordillera de Nombre de Dios, at the edge of the Pico Bonito National Park. Common name McCranie's robber frog has been coined for this species. However, James McCranie himself has argued that this name "should be rejected in favor of a name associated with the type locality instead of a name tied to one of the three authors who named this species".
