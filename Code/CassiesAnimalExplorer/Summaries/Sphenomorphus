The genus Sphenomorphus – vernacularly known as the common skinks – currently serves as a "wastebin taxon" for numerous skinks. While most or all species presently placed here are probably rather close relatives, the genus as presently delimited is likely to be not monophyletic and is in need of review. Some species in this genus have been moved to Pinoyscincus.
The namesake of the Sphenomorphus group of Lygosominae genera, most species would probably occupy a rather basal position therein.
