Prodactylioceras is genus of ammonite that lived during the Pliensbachian stage of early Jurassic. It has evolved from Reynesocoeloceras, but maybe not directly, but through Bettoniceras. Its fossils were found in Europe, Asia and North America.While sometimes, genus Bettoniceras, which differs from Prodactylioceras only by lacking tubercules is considered valid, in other cases it is considered to be a synonym of this genus. Species as P. italicum, or P. colubriforme would not be in that case belonging to this genus, as they are members of genus Bettoniceras.
