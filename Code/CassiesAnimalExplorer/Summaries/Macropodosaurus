Macropodosaurus is an ichnogenus of therizinosaurid footprints from the Late Cretaceous of Asia, North America and Poland. The ichnogenus is currently monotypic only including the type ichnospecies M. gravis, described and named in 1964. When first described, Macropodosaurus tracks were inferred to have been made by a bipedal, yet indeterminate type of dinosaur. In 2006 it was re-evaluated and concluded to represent footprints of therizinosaurid dinosaurs based on comparisons with skeletal feet remains.
