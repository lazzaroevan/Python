Lynx Edicions is a Spanish publishing company specializing in ornithology and natural history. It publishes the Handbook of the Birds of the World, a 16-volume series completed in 2012 that documents for the first time in a single work an entire animal class, illustrating and treating in detail all the species of that class. No such comprehensive work had been completed before for this or any other group in the animal kingdom.
Other books published by this company include the Handbook of the Mammals of the World (a multi-volume undertaking like the work on birds; work on it began in 2009); field guides to birds of various regions (starting in 2018); and Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide, published in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution.
As a complement to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, and with the ultimate goal of disseminating knowledge about the world's avifauna, in 2002 Lynx Edicions started the Internet Bird Collection (IBC). This is a free-access, online audiovisual library of footage of the world's birds which permits the posting of videos, photographs, and recordings illustrating various biological traits of every species (e.g. subspecies, plumage, feeding, breeding, etc.). It is a non-profit endeavour fuelled by material from more than one hundred contributors around the world. 
Lynx Edicions was founded in Barcelona by Ramon Mascort Amigó, a lawyer and collector; Jordi Sargatal, a naturalist; and Josep del Hoyo, a medical doctor and writer. Since 2002, the company has been based in the Bellaterra district of Cerdanyola del Vallès.
