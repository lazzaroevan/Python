Pantotheria is an abandoned taxon of Mesozoic mammals.  This group is now considered an informal "wastebasket" taxon and has been replaced by Dryolestida as well as other groups.  It is sometimes treated as an infraclass and older books refer to it as being related to symmetrodonts.  One classification makes it an infraclass with a single order, Eupantotheria.
