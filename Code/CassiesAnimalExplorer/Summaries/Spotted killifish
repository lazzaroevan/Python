The spotted killifish (Nothobranchius orthonotus) is a small, short lived species of fish, an African rivuline from the family Nothobranchiidae.  These fish are native to many isolated freshwater pools located in the savannah depressions of east Africa, specifically Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. This species of fish occurs in ephemeral waters and killifish eggs can survive long periods of dehydration. The word killifish likely comes from the Dutch kil for kill (small stream).
