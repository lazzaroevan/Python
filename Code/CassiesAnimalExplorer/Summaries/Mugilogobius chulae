It is found in coastal eastern Asia from the Ryukyu Islands south to Sumatra.Yellowstripe goby was described by Hugh McCormick Smith in 1932 and named after Luang Chula Cachanagupta who was Director of the Department of Fisheries of Siam, from where the species was described.When grown to a length of about 3.5â€“4 cm, the male has longer fins and a brighter color than the female.
