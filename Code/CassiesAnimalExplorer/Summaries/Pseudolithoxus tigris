Pseudolithoxus tigris is a species of armored catfish endemic to Venezuela where it is found in the upper Orinoco and Ventuari River basins.  This species grows to a length of 9.4 centimetres (3.7 in) SL.
P. tigris probably matures at a relatively small size; in a specimen about 5 cm (2 in) SL, the snout and pectoral-fin spine odontodes are already greatly elongated, while the odontodes are only beginning to develop in similarly sized specimens of other species.
