Arthroleptides is a small genus of frogs in the family Petropedetidae. Their common name is rocky river frogs. They are found in the mountains of East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, and probably Uganda). They have been considered to belong to Petropedetes, which after exclusion of Arthroleptides is restricted to Central Africa.Arthroleptides species have distinct tympana and no external vocal sacs. Males have femoral glands, and in the breeding state, spiny nuptial excrescences. Tadpoles live on wet rocks out of water.
