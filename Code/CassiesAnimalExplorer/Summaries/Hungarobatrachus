Hungarobatrachus (meaning "Hungarian frog") is an extinct genus of advanced frog. It is a ranoid which lived during the upper Cretaceous period (Santonian age) in what is now Hungary. It is known from isolated ilia and tibio-fibulae recovered from the Iharkút locality in the Csehbánya Formation. This genus was named by Zoltán Szentesi and Márton Venczel in 2010, and the type species is Hungarobatrachus szukacsi.
