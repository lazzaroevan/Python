Deinacrida tibiospina, also known as the Mt Arthur giant wētā or the Nelson alpine giant wētā, is a species of wētā in the family Anostostomatidae. It is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. The wētā is only found in some alpine zones of Kahurangi National Park. Compared with natural densities of other wētā, D. tibiospina is fairly rare. Little conservation effort has been made for this species because, despite its elusiveness, populations on the mainland have been maintained without human intervention.
