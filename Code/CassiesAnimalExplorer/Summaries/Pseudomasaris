Pseudomasaris is a genus of pollen wasps of the family Vespidae, found in arid regions of western North America. They feed their larvae on the pollen and nectar of a variety of plants, though many species prefer flowers in the genus Phacelia. They are colored black with yellow or white markings that, in a few species, resemble the coloration of yellowjackets.
