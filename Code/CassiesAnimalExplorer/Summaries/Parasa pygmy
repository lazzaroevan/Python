Parasa pygmy is a moth of the family Limacodidae. It is found in Taiwan, inhabiting mountains, at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 meters.

The wingspan is 24â€“25 mm. The forewing ground colour is chestnut with a large median green patch delimited externally by a thin white line, which in turn is lined by a brown border. The hindwings are chestnut. Adults have been recorded on wing from mid-August to early October, probably in one generation per year.
The larvae feed on Picea morrisonicola. Larvae have been found in late May. Full-grown larvae have a spindle-like body with a length of about 20 mm. The head and body ground coloration is green. The species probably overwinters as an egg.
