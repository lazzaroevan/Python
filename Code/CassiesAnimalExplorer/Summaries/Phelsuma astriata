Phelsuma astriata, the Seychelles (small) day gecko or stripeless day gecko is a species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae endemic to the Seychelles.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical mangrove forest, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, plantations, rural gardens, and urban areas.
It is threatened by habitat loss. It lives in tropical areas. it eats vegetables of almost any kind.

These geckos possess the significant ability to dramatically change in colour intensity based on the presence or absence of light on or around them. The gecko appears bright green in light, but if kept in a dark place, even for a short period of time, its appearance darkens to an extremely dark green that could easily be mistaken for black when viewed in light. If a light is then shone on the gecko, a visual change seems to occur separately in each scale-like protuberance and gradually the entire gecko changes to a bright green in the light over a period of less than 3 minutes. The tail however changes slightly slower. During the change the gecko appears as a mottled bright and dark green simultaneously. See included images taken in Praslin, Seychelles.
