Sinonyx ("Chinese claw") is a genus of extinct, superficially wolf-like  mesonychid mammals from the late Paleocene of China (about 56 million years ago). It is within the family Mesonychidae, and cladistic analysis of a skull of Sinonyx jiashanensis identifies its closest relative as Ankalagon. S. jiashanensis was discovered in Anhui province, China (30.9°N 120.9°E﻿ / 30.9; 120.9, paleocoordinates 33.9°N 113.6°E﻿ / 33.9; 113.6), in the Tuijinshan formation.
