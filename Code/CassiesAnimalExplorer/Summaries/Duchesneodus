Duchesneodus is a large brontothere endemic to North America. It lived during the Late Eocene 40.4â€”37.2 mya, existing for approximately 3 million years. The skeletal characteristic of the mammal was defined by the dome size that was sexually in two distinct forms. The females had a lower but prominent dome while the males had larger domes.
