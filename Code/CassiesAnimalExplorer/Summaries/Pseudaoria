Pseudaoria is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is distributed in East and Southeast Asia. The genus was first established by Martin Jacoby, in a volume of The Fauna of British India posthumously published in 1908, for two newly described species from Manipur and Burma. Pseudaoria is similar to the genus Aoria. In a review of the latter genus in 2012, L.N. Medvedev included Pseudaoria as a subgenus of it.
