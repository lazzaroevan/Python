The Parastylonuridae are a family of eurypterids, an extinct group of chelicerate arthropods commonly known as "sea scorpions". The family is one of two families contained in the superfamily Stylonuroidea (along with Stylonuridae), which in turn is one of four superfamilies classified as part of the suborder Stylonurina.
