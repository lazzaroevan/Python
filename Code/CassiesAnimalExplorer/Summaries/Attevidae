Attevidae is a family of moths of the Yponomeutoidea superfamily, containing only one genus, Atteva. The group has a pantropical distribution, but at least one species (Atteva aurea) has a range that extends into the temperate zone. No consistent hypotheses regarding the relationships, placement, and ranking of Attevidae have been published, but the prevalent view is that they likely form a monophyletic group within the Yponomeutoidea.
