Cursorius  is a genus of coursers,  a group of wading birds. The genus name derive from Latin cursor, "runner", from currere, "to run".There are five species which breed in Africa and South Asia.
They have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards. Although classed as waders, they inhabit deserts and similar arid regions.
Like the pratincoles, the coursers are found in warmer parts of the Old World. They hunt insects by sight, pursuing them on foot.
Their 2â€“3 eggs are laid on the ground.
