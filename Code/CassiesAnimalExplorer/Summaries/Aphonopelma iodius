Aphonopelma iodius is a species of spider in the tarantula family Theraphosidae, found in United States (California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah). A 1997 paper combined it with three other previously described species (A. angusi, A. melanium,  and A. nevadanum) into a single species, calling it "A. iodium". However, iodius is a neuter comparative adjective and is the correct form. Aphonopelma smithii has also been synonymized with A. iodius. A. iodius is common in the Mojave Desert to the west of the Colorado River. As of 1997, the distribution of A. iodius farther south or west into the Mojave Desert or North into Nevada and Utah was undetermined.
