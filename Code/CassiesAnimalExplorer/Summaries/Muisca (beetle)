Muisca is a genus of checkered beetles of the subfamily of Clerinae or Enopliinae. It is only known from two species, the type species, Muisca bitaeniata and Muisca cylindricollis. The genus was first described by entomologist Maximilian Spinola in 1844.Spinola contributed extensively to the entomological knowledge in the mid 19th century when specimens were brought to him from South America. The Muisca beetle was found in Colombia and part of the collection of Buquet.In 1962 Brazilian zoologist Adriano Peracchi described a species Cregya cylindricollis. Peracchi later transferred this species to the genus Paracregya.  Paracregya cylindricollis was then reclassified as Muisca cylindricollis by Ekis in 1975.
