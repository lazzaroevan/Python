Luciobarbus nasus is a ray-finned fish species in the family Cyprinidae. It is found only in Morocco.
Its natural habitat is freshwater springs. It is becoming rare due to habitat loss.
The taxonomy and systematics of the Maghreb barbs are subject to considerable dispute. Some authors include the much more common L. magniatlantis in L. nasus, while others consider them distinct.
