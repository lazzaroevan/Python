Dabry's sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus), also known as the Yangtze sturgeon, Chiangjiang sturgeon and river sturgeon, is a species of fish in the sturgeon family, Acipenseridae. It is endemic to China and today restricted to the Yangtze River basin, but was also recorded from the Yellow River basin in the past. It was a food fish of commercial importance. Its populations declined drastically, and in the early 1980s, it was designated an endangered species on the Chinese Red List and commercial harvest was banned. It has been listed as a Critically Endangered species by the IUCN since 1996.
