Spidia planola is a moth in the family Drepanidae. It was described by Watson in 1965. It is found in Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone.The length of the forewings is about 15 mm for males and 15â€“17 mm for females. Both wings are buff, lightly speckled with dark brown, the forewings with two dark grey costal markings and a dark reddish brown discocellular spot and similarly coloured spots at the posterior and anterior angles of the cell. There is a dark reddish-brown streak extending from the anterior angle of the cell to about half-way along the posterior margin of the areole and a second dark reddish-brown streak extends from the discocellular spot to the base of the wing. There are also six greenish, iridescent patches and a faintly marked oblique postmedial fascia from near the apex to about half the length of the inner margin. There is also a trace of dark subterminal markings near the tornus. The hindwings have a broad, weakly marked, reddish buff, antemedial fascia, a dark reddish brown discocellular spot and a spot at the posterior angle of the cell, as well as a small hyaline patch close to the end of the cell and a reddish grey postmedial shade in the posterior half of the wing. The subterminal area is more reddish than the remainder of the wing.
