Phasianotrochus irisodontes, common name maireener, rainbow kelp shell, or green necklace shell, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails.Found off the coast of Tasmania, the shells have been used to make necklaces by Aboriginal Tasmanian women in a cultural practice going back thousands of years. The effects of climate change and human recreational activities have reduced the populations of the snails in recent years.
