Paraphilaeus is a genus of the jumping spiders found in Queensland and New South Wales. It contains only one species, Paraphilaeus daemeli. Though it has been known for a long time, in 2003, closer investigation showed that it represents a new genus and is neither related to Plexippus nor Trite. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek para "alongside" and the salticid genus Philaeus.
They are 4â€“6 mm in length. The male palpal bulb has a very elongate cymbium, its outer half distinctly curved. The embolus is very long, passing across the ventral surface of the tegulum and along the edge of cymbium.
