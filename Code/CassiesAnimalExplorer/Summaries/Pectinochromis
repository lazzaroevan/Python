Pectinochromis is a monospecific genus of ray-finned fish from the subfamily Pseudoplesiopinae in the family Pseudochromidae, the dottybacks. The only species in the genus is Pectinochromis lubbocki, a small reef living dottyback from the Red Sea. This genus is the sister taxon to the genus Chlidichthys. The specific name honours the Cambridge University ichthyologist Roger Lubbock (1951â€“1981), in recognition of his work on the taxonomy of the subfamily Pseudoplesiopinae.
