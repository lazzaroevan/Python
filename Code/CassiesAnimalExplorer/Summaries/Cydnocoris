Cydnocoris is a genus of assassin bugs found in tropical Asia. It has been suggested that this genus be either treated as a synonym of Cutocoris Stål,  1859 or the later name be suppressed.Cydnocoris gilvus has been considered a potential biological control agent against Helopeltis as it is mass-culturable with low cannibalism. A post-mortem on a patient found that death had been caused by choking from inflamed throat caused by a Cydnocoris gilvus that had been accidentally ingested.Species in the genus include:

Cydnocoris fasciatus Reuter,1881
Cydnocoris gilvus (Burmeister, 1837)
Cydnocoris crocatus Stål, 1866
Cydnocoris russatus Stål, 1867
