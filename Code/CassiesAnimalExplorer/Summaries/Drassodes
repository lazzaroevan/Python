Drassodes is a genus of ground spiders that was first described by Niklas Westring in 1851. They are brown, gray, and red spiders that live under rocks or bark in mostly dry habitats, and are generally 3.8 to 11.6 millimetres (0.15 to 0.46 in) long, but can reach up to 20 millimetres (0.79 in) in length.
