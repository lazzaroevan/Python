Sesioidea is the superfamily currently containing clearwing moths (Sesiidae), castniid moths (Castniidae) and little bear moths (Brachodidae). There is evidence from head and thoracic morphology that the first two families, internally feeding in plants as caterpillars, are sisters, whilst some brachodids are known to feed on leaf surfaces (Edwards et al., 1999). Sesioidea are considered to be the sister group of Cossoidea[1] which contain the also internal-feeding Goat and Leopard moths.
