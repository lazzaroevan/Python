The marbled hatchetfish (Carnegiella strigata) is a small, normally 3.5 cm (1.4 in) in length, freshwater ray-finned fish native to South America.  Hatchet shaped, it presents a gold line extending from its eye to its caudal fin while the area below has a brown and cream colored marble-like pattern (hence its name).
