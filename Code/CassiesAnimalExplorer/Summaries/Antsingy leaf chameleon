The Antsingy leaf chameleon (Brookesia perarmata) is a species of lizards in the family Chamaeleonidae. It is also referred to as Armoured leaf chameleon.This species is endemic to Madagascar and can only be found in the dry deciduous forests of the northern area of the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park in Madagascar's Melaky Region. These chameleons were popular pets for a short time leading to a severely decreasing population trend before pet trade of the species was banned. Deforestation and habitat degradation continue to affect their numbers despite conservation efforts within their range.
