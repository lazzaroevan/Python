The Pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) is a species of deer that live in the grasslands of South America at low elevations. They are known as venado or gama in Spanish and as veado-campeiro in Portuguese. Their habitat includes water and hills, often with winter drought, and grass that is high enough to cover a standing deer.  Many of them live on the Pantanal wetlands, where there are ongoing conservation efforts, and other areas of annual flooding cycles.  Human activity has changed much of the original landscape.  They are known to live up to 12 years in the wild, longer if captive, but are threatened due to over-hunting and habitat loss.  Many people are concerned over this loss, because a healthy deer population means a healthy grassland, and a healthy grassland is home to many species, some also threatened.  Many North American birds migrate south to these areas, and if the Pampas deer habitat is lost, they are afraid these bird species will also decline.  There are approximately 80,000 Pampas deer total, with the majority of them living in Brazil.
