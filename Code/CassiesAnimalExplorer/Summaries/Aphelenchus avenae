Aphelenchus avenae is a mycophagous nematode capable of feeding on plant tissue in culture.
Feeding: Hyphal feeder; Aphelenchus avenae feeds on a variety of fungi, but is not known to feed on higher plants.
Hosts: Fungi
Life Cycle: Males seem fairly common in some populations, less frequent in others; Capable of withstanding dry conditions through anhydrobiosis. Used as a model system for studying anhydrobiosis.
Management: Numbers are increased by addition of complex organic materials to soil to enhance fungal decomposition.
