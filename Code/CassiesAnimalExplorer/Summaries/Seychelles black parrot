The Seychelles black parrot, Praslin parrot or kato nwar (Coracopsis barklyi) is a sombre-coloured, medium-sized parrot endemic to the Seychelles.  Historically, it has been treated as a subspecies of the lesser vasa parrot, although it shows morphological, ecological and behavioural differences. Recent phylogenetic research indicates that the Seychelles population has a long history of isolation and may be sister to the rest of Coracopsis. It is the national bird of the Seychelles.
