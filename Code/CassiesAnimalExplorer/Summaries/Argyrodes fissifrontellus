Argyrodes fissifrontellus is a species of tangle-web spider that is endemic to the Seychelles, and can be found on Mah√© and Silhouette islands. It is found in woodland areas where it spins orb webs in vegetation, or is a keptoparasite in red-legged golden orb-web spider webs. It is threatened by habitat deterioration due to invasive plants, especially Cinnamomum verum.
