Panthera onca mesembrina is an extinct subspecies of the jaguar that was endemic to southern South America during the Pleistocene epoch (1.8 myaâ€“11,000 years ago). The fossils of this large felid from late Pleistocene localities in southern Chile and Argentina have been reported in 2017 to be remains of the American lion (Panthera atrox).
