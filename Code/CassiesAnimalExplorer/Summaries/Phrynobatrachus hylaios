Phrynobatrachus hylaios is a species of frog in the family Phrynobatrachidae. It is known from southern Cameroon and western Republic of the Congo, although its range presumably extends into nearby Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. It was first described as a subspecies of Phrynobatrachus werneri. Common name Foulassi river frog has been coined for it.
