Sedasta is a genus of African orb-weaver spiders containing the single species, Sedasta ferox. It was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1894, and has only been found in West Africa. It was originally placed with the tangle-web spiders, and though was moved to the orb-weavers in 1985, it is still sometimes considered to be a theridiid or a long-jawed orb weaver.
