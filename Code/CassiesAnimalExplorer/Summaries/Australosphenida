The Australosphenida are a proposed infraclass of mammals within subclass Yinotheria. Today, there are only five surviving species, which live in Australia and New Guinea, but fossils have been found in Madagascar and Argentina. The surviving species consist of the platypus and four species of echidna. Contrary to other known crown mammals, they retained postdentary bones as shown by the presence of a postdentary trough. The extant members (monotremes) developed the mammalian middle ear independently.
