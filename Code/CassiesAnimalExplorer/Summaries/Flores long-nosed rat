The Flores long-nosed rat, also known as Paula's long-nosed rat, (Paulamys naso) is a species of rodent endemic to Flores Island, Indonesia. This species was first described from subfossil fragments collected  in the 1950s by Theodor Verhoeven, who named it Paula's long-nosed rat, and was named Floresomys naso by Guy Musser in 1981. Since Floresomys was preoccupied, Musser changed the name to Paulamys, after Verhoeven's life partner Paula Hamerlinck. A living specimen was reported from the montane forest of western Flores in 1989. It is recorded as common between 1,000 and 2,000 m above sea level on the volcanic mountain Gunung Ranakah, but is believed to be threatened by habitat destruction. It is the only known member of the genus Paulamys .  The genera Papagomys, Komodomys and Paulamys are closer related to each other than to other murids, suggesting an adaptive radiation.
