Phrynobatrachus congicus is a poorly known species of frog in the family Phrynobatrachidae. It might be endemic to Democratic Republic of the Congoâ€”it is only known from its unspecific type locality "Congo", which presumably corresponds to the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. The specific name congicus attests to its origins: the Latin suffix -icus is meaning "to belong to". Common name Congo river frog has been coined for this species.
