The Carolina mantis (Stagmomantis carolina) is a species of praying mantis of the subfamily Stagmomantinae.
Sexual cannibalism occurs in roughly one quarter of all intersexual encounters of this species, though specimens of this species will engage in cannibalism regardless of age or gender if the opportunity presents itself.

Carolina mantis oothecae can be purchased in garden supply centers as a means of biological control of pest insects. However, only those labeled as this species should be released because most oothecae sold in the United States belong to the invasive Chinese mantis. It is the state insect of South Carolina.
