Lucilia illustris is a member of the fly family Calliphoridae, commonly known as a blow fly. Along with several other species, L. illustris is commonly referred to as a green bottle fly. L. illustris is typically 6â€“9 mm in length and has a metallic blue-green thorax. The larvae develop in three instars, each with unique developmental properties. The adult fly typically will feed on flowers, but the females need some sort of carrion protein in order to breed and lay eggs.
Due to the predictable nature of development, Lucilia illustris is often used by forensic entomologists to determine time and place of death. Medically, L. illustris is often used for Maggot Debridement Therapy because it only causes myiasis in necrotic tissue. Lucilia illustris was first described by the German entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1826. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin illustris 'brilliant'.
