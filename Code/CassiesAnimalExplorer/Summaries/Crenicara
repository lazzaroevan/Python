Crenicara is a small genus of cichlid fishes native to creeks and rivers in the Amazon and Essequibo basins in South America. These cichlids have several dark spots on the sides of their bodies, and do not surpass 10 cm (3.9 in) in length.
In the past, the members of the genus Dicrossus were sometimes included in Crenicara. Members of both genera are sometimes known as checkerboard or chessboard cichlids.
