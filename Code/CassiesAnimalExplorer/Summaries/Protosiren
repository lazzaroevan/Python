Protosiren is an extinct early genus of the order Sirenia.  Protosiren existed throughout the Lutetian to Priabonian stages of the Middle Eocene. Fossils have been found in the far-flung locations like the United States (South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida), Africa (Egypt), Europe (France, Germany and Hungary) and Asia (India and Pakistan).
So far, five species have been named. From comparative anatomy and chronological order, it has been suggested that P. fraasi, P. sattaensis and P. smithae respresent an ancestor-descendant lineage. P. eothene is the oldest and smallest species.
