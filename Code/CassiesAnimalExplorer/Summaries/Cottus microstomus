Cottus microstomus is a species of sculpin, a European freshwater fish in the family Cottidae. It is widespread in the Dniester drainage (Black Sea basin), Odra and Vistula drainages (southern Baltic basin), most likely extending further east to the Gulf of Finland. It is part of the wider European Cottus gobio complex, and possibly makes hybrid zones with Cottus gobio (European bullhead) and Cottus koshewnikowi.  It is a demersal fish, up to 10.1 cm long.
