The big-scaled dwarf gecko, big-scaled least gecko, or cotton ginner (Sphaerodactylus grandisquamis) is a species of lizard in the family Sphaerodactylidae. It is endemic to  Puerto Rico. Sphaerodactylus grandisquamis was formerly a subspecies of Sphaerodactylus macrolepis but was elevated to full species status using a combination of molecular and morphological data. Sphaerodactylus g. phoberus is no longer considered valid and was synonymized with S. g. grandiquamis.
