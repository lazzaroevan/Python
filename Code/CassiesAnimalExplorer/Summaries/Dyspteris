Dyspteris is a monotypic moth genus in the family Geometridae erected by Jacob Hübner in 1818 found in North America. Its only species, Dyspteris abortivaria, the bad-wing, was first described by Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Schäffer in 1855. It is called "bad-wing" because its forewing is much larger than its hindwing, making it often difficult to pull into position for spreading.The MONA or Hodges number for Dyspteris abortivaria is 7648.
