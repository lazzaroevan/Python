Spodoptera cilium, known variously as dark mottled willow, lawn caterpillar and grasslawn armyworm, is a noctuid moth found throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and western, southern, and south-east Asia and several countries in southern and eastern Europe. It is a migrant to northern Europe and has been recorded at least nine times in the United Kingdom.
The larva feeds on Oryza.  It is sometimes a pest.
