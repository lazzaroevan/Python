The long-tailed myna (Mino kreffti) is a member of the starling family. It is resident in the Bismarck Archipelago and northern Solomon Islands. It resembles the yellow-faced myna, and the two were formerly considered conspecific.
Its binomial name commemorates Gerard Krefft, Australian zoologist and palaeontologist.
