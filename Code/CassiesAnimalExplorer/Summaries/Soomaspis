Soomaspis is a genus of small to average size (about 3 cm or 1.2-inch long) marine arthropods in the Liwiidae Family, that lived during the late Ordovician (early Hirnantian). Fossil remains of Soomaspis were collected from the Soom Shale Lagerst√§tte in Western Cape, South Africa. Soomaspis looks like a large, soft agnostid trilobite. It has a headshield (or cephalon) wider than the tailshield (pygidium), and in between them three thoracic body segments (somites). The genus is monotypic, its sole species being Soomaspis splendida.
