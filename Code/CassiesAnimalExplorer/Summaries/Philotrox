Philotrox is an extinct monospecific genus of the Hesperocyoninae subfamily of early canids native to North America. It lived during the Oligocene, 30.8â€”26.3 Ma, existing for approximately 5 million years. In form, it was intermediate between the small Cynodesmus and the later Enhydrocyon, the first hypercarnivorous, "bone-cracking", canid.
