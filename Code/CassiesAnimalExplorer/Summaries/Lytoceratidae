Lytoceratidae is a taxonomic family of ammonoid cephalopods belonging to the suborder Lytoceratina, characterized by  very evolute shells that generally enlarge rapidly, having whorls in contact but mostly overlapping very sightly, or not at all.
Surface ornament may consist of various combinations of straight or crinkled growth lines, flares, constrictions, and, more rarely, plications. Sutures are highly complex and moss-like, but with few major elements. Lateral lobes are widely splayed and blunt, or with obliquely deflected end. The external, ventral, lobe is short.
The Lytoceratinae have a worldwide distribution and a stratigraphic range extending from the middle Lower Jurassic (Pliensbachian) to the early Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian).
