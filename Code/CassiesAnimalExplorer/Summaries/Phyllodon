Phyllodon (meaning "leaf tooth") was a genus of small ornithischian dinosaur from the Kimmeridgian-age Upper Jurassic Camadas de Guimarota Formation of Leiria, Portugal and possibly also the Chipping Norton Limestone of England. It may have been closely related to contemporaneous dinosaurs in North America.
This genus is known from teeth and possibly partial lower jaws. The name is also in use for a genus of modern moss, but this is not considered to be a problem because the two organisms are in two different kingdoms.
