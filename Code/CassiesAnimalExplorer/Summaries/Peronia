Peronia is a genus of air-breathing sea slugs, a shell-less marine pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Onchidiidae.Even if the name Onchis as proposed by Férussac, 1822 [April]  is older than Peronia Fleming, 1822 [June], there is no need to replace Peronia (adopted by Labbé and others) by Onchis (a name that was almost completely forgotten). The systematics of the family Onchidiidae is already quite confusing and there is no need to disrupt it further. Therefore Onchis is accepted as a synonym of Peronia. Onchis was proposed by Férussac in 1822 without description or indication, so it was a nomen nudum and not made available at that occasion.
