Aspades hutchinsonella is a species of moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Walsingham in 1891. It is found in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.The wingspan is 10â€“14 mm. The forewings are stramineous, with a brownish fuscous spot at the extreme base of the costa, then shaded with greyish fuscous along the costal margin nearly to the commencement of the costo-apical cilia. Along the centre of this costal shade is a line of chestnut scales reaching to half the length of the wing. Contiguous to the lower edge of the costal shade, but before the middle, is a distinct black spot. A conspicuous greyish fuscous patch lies on the dorsal margin contiguous to the anal angle, its rounded inner edge narrowly margined by a line of black scales, its outer extremity touched with chestnut. This patch is connected at the anal angle with a shade of the same colour, which follows the apical margin to the apex, interrupted only by a small marginal spot of the pale stramineous ground colour, immediately below the apex, by which the darker shade appears to be deflected inwards. The hindwings are grey.
