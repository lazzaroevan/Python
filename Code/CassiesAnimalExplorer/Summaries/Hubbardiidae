Hubbardiidae is a family of arachnids, superficially resembling spiders. It is the larger of the two extant families of the order, Schizomida, and is divided into two subfamilies. The family is based on the description published by Orator F. Cook in 1899, and was previously named as Schizomidae. The American Arachnological Society assigns the common name hubbardiid shorttailed whipscorpion to members of this familyThe classification of the family includes 51 genera. Seven of these genera are found in Australia (of which five are endemic): Draculoides, Julattenius, Notozomus, Attenuizomus and Brignolizomus. Five genera are found in Mexico, three of which are endemic (Pacal, Mayazomus and Sotanostenochrus).
