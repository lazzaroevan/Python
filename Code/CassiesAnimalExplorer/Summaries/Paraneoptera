Paraneoptera  or Acercaria is a monophyletic superorder of insects which includes four orders, the bark lice, true lice, thrips, and hemipterans, the true bugs.All of the insects classified here exhibit various “reductions” or “simplifications” from the primitive body-plan found in typical polyneopterans.  Cerci, for example, are entirely absent in all living paraneopterans (Acercaria meaning without cerci).  Other “reductions” occur in wing venation, in the number of tarsal segments (not more than three), in the number of Malpighian tubules (not more than six), and in the number of ganglia present in the ventral nerve cord (not more than five).
The mouthparts of the Paraneoptera reflect diverse feeding habits. Basal groups are microbial surface feeders, whereas more advanced groups feed on plant or animal fluids.
