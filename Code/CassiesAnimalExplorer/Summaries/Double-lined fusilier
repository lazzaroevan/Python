The double-lined fusilier (Pterocaesio digramma), also known as the banana fish, is a fusilier of the genus Pterocaesio. Double-lined fusiliers are widespread in the Western Pacific, ranging from Indonesia to Western Australia, New Caledonia and northwards to Japan.  They are found in coastal areas, primarily around coral reefs.Gurukun (グルクン), the prefectural fish of Okinawa, Japan, often refers to the double-lined fusilier, but is actually a generic term for Pterocaesio. The Standard Japanese name is takasago (タカサゴ, 高砂), with many regional variants.
