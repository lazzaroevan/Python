Phoneutria fera is a species of spider with medically significant venom in the family Ctenidae found in South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Suriname, and Guyana). It is commonly known as the Brazilian wandering spider and the banana spider, although these names are applied to other species in the genus Phoneutria, particularly Phoneutria nigriventer. P. fera tends to spend a larger amount of time in vegetation during the early period of its life and spends more time on the ground once it becomes larger. This is more common in females, since they are usually larger than males. Medical records from within the geographic range of P. fera show bites (likely from P. fera or its close relative P. reidyi), have the potential to develop moderate to severe systematic reactions in humans.
