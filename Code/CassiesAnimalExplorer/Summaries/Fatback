Fatback is a cut of meat from a domestic pig.  It consists of the layer of adipose tissue (subcutaneous fat) under the skin of the back, with or without the skin (pork rind). Fatback is "hard fat" and is distinct from the visceral fat that occurs in the abdominal cavity which is called "soft fat" and is used to produce leaf lard.
Like other types of pig fat, fatback may be rendered to make a high quality lard. It is one source of salt pork.  Finely diced or coarsely ground fatback is an important ingredient in sausage making and in some meat dishes.
Fatback is an important element of traditional charcuterie. In several European cultures it is used to make specialty bacon.  Containing no skeletal muscle, this bacon is a delicacy.
At one time fatback was Italy's basic cooking fat, especially in regions where olive trees are sparse or absent, but health concerns have reduced its popularity. However, it provides a rich, authentic flavour for the classic battuto – sautéed vegetables, herbs and flavourings – that forms the basis of many traditional dishes. Today, pancetta is often used instead.
