Percarina is a genus of ray-finned fish in the family Percidae they are found in eastern Europe. The genus is the only taxon in the monotypic subfamily Percarininae which is characterised by having the first dorsal fin having 9-11 spines and being widely separated from the second dorsal fin. They are thought to be closely related both to the perches of the genus Perca and to the ruffes of the genus Gymnocephalus.
