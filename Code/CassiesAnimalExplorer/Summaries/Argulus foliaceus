Argulus foliaceus (or Monoculus foliaceus Linnaeus, 1758 name) is a species of crustaceans in the family Argulidae, the fish lice. It is sometimes called the common fish louse. It is "the most common and widespread native argulid in the Palaearctic" and "one of the most widespread crustacean ectoparasites of freshwater fish in the world", considering its distribution and range of hosts. It can cause the severe disease state argulosis in a wide variety of fish species. It is responsible for epizootic outbreaks that have led to the collapse of aquaculture operations. Fish lice are not related to lice, which are insects.
