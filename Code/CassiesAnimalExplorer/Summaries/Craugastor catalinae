Craugastor catalinae is a species of frogs in the family Craugastoridae. It is found in the Río Cotón drainage in the Pacific southwestern Costa Rica and on the Pacific slopes of Volcán Barú, western Panama. The specific name catalinae, rather obliquely, honors Karen R. Lips:  Spanish name "Catalina" corresponds to Danish name "Karen". Lips collected a part of the type series and has "contributed substantially to our knowledge of the Río Cotón drainage herpetofauna and the declining amphibian populations problem in lower Central America."
