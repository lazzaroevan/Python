Arkarua adami is a small, Precambrian disk-like fossil with a raised center, a number of radial ridges on the rim, and a five-pointed central depression marked with radial lines of five small dots from the middle of the disk center. Fossils range from 3 to 10 mm in diameter.
Arkarua is known only from the Ediacaran beds of the Flinders Ranges in South Australia.  The generic name refers to Arkaru, a mythical giant snake of the local Aboriginal people.
