Spix's warbling antbird (Hypocnemis striata) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae.
Spix's warbling antbird was described and illustrated by the German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix in 1825 and given the binomial name Thamnophilus striatus. The current genus Hypocnemis was introduced in 1847.  Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the Guianan warbling antbird (Hypocnemis cantator), but based on vocal differences and to a lesser degree differences in plumage, it is now treated as separate species.There are three subspecies:
H. s. implicata Zimmer, JT, 1932 – west central Amazonian Brazil
H. s. striata (von Spix, 1825) – central Amazonian Brazil
H. s. affinis Zimmer, JT, 1932 – east central Amazonian BrazilThe westernmost population is likely to represent an undescribed subspecies. Spix's warbling antbird is found at lower levels in humid forest in the south-eastern Amazon of Brazil.
