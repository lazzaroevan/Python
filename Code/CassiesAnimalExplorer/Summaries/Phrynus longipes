Phrynus longipes is a species of amblypygid (whip spider) often found in the Caribbean. They are also found in other warm climate areas such as the forests of Central America. Within this region, however, Phrynus longipes lives in an array of habitats from caves to coastlines. They are protective of their territory, using their pedipalps to deter predators or unwanted visitors. Being nocturnal predators, they take shelter during the day and hunt primarily at night. Phrynus longipes feed on both vertabrates and invertebrates. They are the first amblypygid to be recorded feeding on an avian species.
