Arganasuchus is an extinct genus of "rauisuchian" (loricatan) archosaur. It is known from a single species, Arganasuchus dutuiti. Fossils of this genus have been found in Upper Triassic rocks of the Argana Basin, Morocco. Though its remains were initially referred to Ticinosuchus when discovered during the 1970s, in 2007 it was identified as a distinct genus with unique features of the pubis and maxilla. Arganasuchus also had several anatomical details in common with Batrachotomus, Fasolasuchus, and Postosuchus, though its relations with other loricatans remains unresolved. Arganasuchus is considered a carnivore due to its large, knife-shaped teeth.
