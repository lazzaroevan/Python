Mauligobius is a genus of ray-finned fish from the family Gobiidae native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The name of this genus honours the ichthyologist and taxidermist GÃ¼nther Edmund Maul (1909-1997) of the Museu Municipal do Funchal on Madeira for his assistance in making material and information available which the author, Peter Miller, used in his research on Macaronesian gobies.
