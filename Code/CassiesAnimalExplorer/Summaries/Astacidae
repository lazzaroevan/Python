The Astacidae comprise the freshwater crayfish native to Europe and western North America. The family is made up of three genera: The genera Astacus (which includes the European crayfish and Turkish crayfish) and Austropotamobius are both found throughout Europe and parts of western Asia, while Pacifastacus is found on the Pacific coast of the United States and British Columbia and includes the signal crayfish and the Shasta crayfish.
