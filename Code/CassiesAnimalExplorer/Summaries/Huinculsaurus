Huinculsaurus (meaning "Huincul Formation lizard") is a genus of elaphrosaurine noasaurid dinosaur from the Huincul Formation in Neuqu√©n Province, Argentina. The type and only species is Huinculsaurus montesi. It was probably around 3 metres (9.8 ft) when fully grown, although this is only speculation since no fully mature specimens are currently known.
