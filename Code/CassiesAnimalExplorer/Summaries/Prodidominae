Prodidominae is a spider subfamily, sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders. It was formerly regarded as a separate family, Prodidomidae, which was reduced to a subfamily of the Gnaphosidae in 2018.Spiders in the subfamily are easily identified by the greatly elongated base of the piriform gland spigots. At least parts of their body are covered with shiny scales or setae. The posterior median eyes are flat and silvery, with a triangular, egg-shaped or irregularly rectangular shape.
