The Steropodontidae was a possible family of monotremes that are known from fossils from the Cretaceous of Australia.
There are two genera placed in this family: Steropodon and Teinolophos, which have been tentatively placed in the family due to the similarity of the lower molars in these two genera. However, the latter may be more basal.
