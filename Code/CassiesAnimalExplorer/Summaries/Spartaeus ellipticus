Spartaeus ellipticus is a species of jumping spiders found only in Taiwan. It has a total length (excluding legs) of nearly 6 mm. The carapace is dark brown with paler markings towards the rear and a black margin. The whole carapace is densely covered with white hair. The legs are brown with many large, prominent spines.
