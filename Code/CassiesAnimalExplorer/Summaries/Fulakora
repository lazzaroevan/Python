Fulakora is a genus of ants in the subfamily Amblyoponinae. The genus has a worldwide distribution, and like most other amblyoponines, Fulakora species are specialized predators. It was originally described as, and for a long time considered to be, a subgenus of Stigmatomma until it was elevated to an independent genus by Ward & Fisher (2016).
