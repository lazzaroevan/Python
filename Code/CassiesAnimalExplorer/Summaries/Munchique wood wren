The Munchique wood wren (Henicorhina negreti) is a member of the wren family (Troglodytidae), described as new to science in 2003.  It was first observed by Steven Hilty in the 1980s and not described until detailed studies by Paul Salaman, Paul Coopmans, Thomas Donegan and others in the region in 2001.  The Munchique wood wren is replaced sharply by the grey-breasted wood wren at lower elevations and on an opposite Andean mountain slope.
The bird is found on the Munchique Massif in the western Andes in the Cauca Endemic Bird Area in the south to Western Antioquia and Eastern Choco in the north-western Colombia.
The species' scientific name honours Álvaro José Negret, a Colombian ornithologist who died in 1998.
The Munchique wood wren was the first bird species to be described as new to science in an electronic journal rather than in a traditional print-only journal (http://www.ornitologiacolombiana.org).
