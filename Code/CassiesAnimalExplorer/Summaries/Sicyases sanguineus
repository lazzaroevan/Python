Sicyases sanguineus is a species of amphibious marine clingfish in the family Gobiesocidae. It lives in the Southeast Pacific along the entire coast of Chile and southern Peru.Locally, it is known as pejesapo (literally, frog-fish). It inhabits shallow waters, including the intertidal zone. It can often be seen on exposed rocks above water, where it is able to breathe via the branchial surfaces and the skin. As long as it is kept moist by the splash of the wave action, it can survive for up to three days on land. Together with Chorisochismus dentex of southern Africa, it is the largest species of clingfish at up to 30 cm (12 in) long.
