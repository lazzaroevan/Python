A Primate's Memoir is a book by the American biologist Robert M. Sapolsky. The book documents Sapolsky's years in Kenya studying baboons as a graduate student.  The chapters alternate between describing observations of a troop of baboons and the wildly different culture in Africa that he is increasingly cognizant of.  The book portrays an unconventional way of studying neurophysiology to determine the effects of stress on life expectancy.
The book was nominated for The Aventis Prizes for Science Books in 2002.
