Falbouria is a genus of flies in the family Dolichopodidae, endemic to the Azores. It contains only one species, Falbouria acorensis. It was originally named Balfouria by Octave Parent in 1933; it was renamed to Falbouria by C. E. Dyte in 1980 after the name Balfouria was found to be preoccupied by the snail genus Balfouria (Crosse, 1884).
