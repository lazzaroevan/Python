Palaeopropithecus is a recently extinct genus of large sloth lemurs from Madagascar related to living lemur species found there today. Three species are known, Palaeopropithecus ingens, P. maximus, and P. kelyus. Radiocarbon dates indicate that they may have survived until around 1300 - 1620 CE. Malagasy legends of the tretretretre or tratratratra are thought to refer to P. ingens.
Evidence suggests a solely arboreal lifestyle with frequent upside down suspension, hence the name sloth lemur.
