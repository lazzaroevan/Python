Somatia is the sole genus of the acalyptrate brachyceran fly family Somatiidae. The genus includes about seven Neotropical species of small (3-5 mm long) black and yellow flies with a stout and rounded thorax having transverse suture. The legs are separated from the main body by an elongated post-coxal bridge. The broad abdomen is downcurved. The antenna are elbowed with the arista bipectinate. Somatiids resemble members of the Syringogastridae due to the enlarged pronotum and a postcoxal bridge but they have a petiolate abdomen.Adult Somatia have been feeding on a dead caterpillar and aggregating on the extra-floral nectaries of Solanaceae, Bignoniaceae and Passifloraceae.The placement of the group is doubtful, it is placed in the Diopsoidea but an incomplete phylogenetic analysis has suggested a closeness to the Agromyzidae.Species in the genus include:

Somatia aestiva
Somatia australis
Somatia carrerai
Somatia lanei
Somatia papaveroi
Somatia schildi
Somatia sophiston
