Dryaderces inframaculata is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is endemic to Brazil and known from between the Tapajós and Xingu Rivers in Pará. Until recently, it was only known from one specimen collected near Santarém, probably around 1876, by Henry Wickham. Common name Santarem treefrog has been coined for it.
