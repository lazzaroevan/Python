The hooting frog (Heleioporus barycragus) is a species of frog in the family Limnodynastidae.
It is endemic to Australia.
Its natural habitats are temperate forests and intermittent rivers.
The hooting frog is the largest member of the genus Heleioporus found in Western Australia. Like all west Australian species it breeds in late autumn and winter, calling from a burrow in which the female later deposits a foamy egg mass. Males excavate burrows in the banks of bottom of dry watercourses, usually lateritic clay based streams of the Darling Range.
barycragus means 'deep-voiced' in reference to the low 'hooting' call that also gives its common name. While it is also known as the  western marsh frog, this name is confusing as the species does not occur in or near marshes, and may be confused with the species Limnodynastes dorsalis.
