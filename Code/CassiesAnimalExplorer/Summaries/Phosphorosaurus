Phosphorosaurus ("Phosphate Lizard") is an extinct genus of marine lizard belonging to the mosasaur family. Phosphorosaurus is classified within the Halisaurinae subfamily alongside the genera Pluridens, Eonatator and Halisaurus.Stratigraphically, Phosphorosaurus only occurs in the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. Although treated as synonymous with Halisaurus in the past, recent studies recognize it as valid. Two species are known, Phosphorosaurus ortliebi from the Craie de Ciply Formation in Belgium, and P. ponpetelegans from the Hakobuchi Formation of Hokkaido in Japan. P. ponpetelegans is only known from the very earliest Maastrichtian, whilst P. ortliebi occurs throughout the Maastrichtian.
