Conorbidae  is a monophyletic family of small to medium-sized sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Conoidea. Despite the name of the family, which might seem to suggest otherwise, this group of gastropods are not cone snails, but are instead what used to be loosely called "turrids".
