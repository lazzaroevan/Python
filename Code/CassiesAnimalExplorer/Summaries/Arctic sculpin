The Arctic sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpioides) or the northern sculpin, is a predatory species of sculpin in the fish family Cottidae.  The species is native to the Arctic Ocean around Canada and Greenland, specifically in James Bay and the Strait of Belle Isle, and towards the Bering Sea.   It has the ability to synthesize antifreeze proteins, allowing it to withstand temperatures as low as -2 Â°C.  It serves as the host for Haemobaphes cyclopterina, a parasitic species of copepod.
