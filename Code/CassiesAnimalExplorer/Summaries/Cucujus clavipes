Cucujus clavipes is known as the flat bark beetle. It is found throughout North America. These are generally found near tree line   under bark  of dead poplar and ash trees. C. clavipes are described as phloem-feeding   and often predators  of other small insects, such as wood-boring beetles, and mites. These are usually seen during spring-summer seasons. Having a cold habitat, these beetles must go through several physiological mechanisms to survive; they are recognised for their ability to change their overwintering mechanisms.
