The Donaciinae, aquatic leaf beetles, are a subfamily of the leaf beetle family Chrysomelidae, characterised by distinctly long antennae. They are found in mainly the Holarctic, with very few species in the Southern Hemisphere.
Donaciinae larvae are aquatic, and attach themselves to underwater stems and roots of their plant hosts for food and oxygen. Adults live in vegetation bordering ponds, marshes, and lakes.
