Protepicyon is an extinct monospecific genus of the Borophaginae subfamily of canids native to North America. It lived during the Barstovian stage of the Middle Miocene 16.0â€”13.6 mya. One of the top predators of its time, it was the probable ancestor of the better known Epicyon, and is known from remains in California and New Mexico.
