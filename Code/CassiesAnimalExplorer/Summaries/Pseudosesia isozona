Pseudosesia isozona is a moth of the family Sesiidae. It is found in Queensland, Australia.
The length of the forewings is 10â€“11 mm for males and about 11 mm for females.
This species (at least superficially) resembles Pseudosesia oberthuri. If the two species are closely related, Pseudosesia isozona may be found to be a borer in some species of native vine as well as Pseudosesia oberthuri.
