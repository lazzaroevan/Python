Spectrovenator ("ghost hunter", named because the holotype was unexpectedly found under the holotype of Tapuiasaurus) is a genus of basal abelisaurid theropod that lived during the early Cretaceous period in what is now Brazil. It is known by a single species, S. ragei, recovered from the Quiric√≥ Formation.
