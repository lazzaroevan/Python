Parahypsugo is a genus of bat in the family Vespertilionidae. Members of this genus are distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and were formerly classified in either Pipistrellus, Neoromicia, or Hypsugo until being reclassified into the new genus Parahypsugo in a 2019 study. The study also described a new species in the genus, named P. happoldorum, and also found the subspecies Pipistrellus eisentrauti bellieri to constitute a separate species within Parahypsugo. The name of the genus roughly translates to "near Hypsugo", which references the close genetic and morphological relationship between this genus and Hypsugo.
