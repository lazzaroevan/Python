Austrocochlea is a genus of medium-sized sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Trochidae, the top snails, also known as top shells.This genus was founded as a subgenus by Fisher in 1885 to include a small group of Australian species, included in the genus Monodonta. They had previously been included in Trochocochlea Klein, 1753 ( = Osilinus Philippi, 1847), a section that was then restricted to the Mediterranean group.
