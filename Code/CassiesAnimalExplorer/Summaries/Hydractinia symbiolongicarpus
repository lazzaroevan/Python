Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus is one of the 30 + Hydractinia species known worldwide.  This saltwater animal, from here on referred to as Hydractinia, is at the base of the Cnidaria phylum and in many ways, is similar to the freshwater Hydra.  In the wild, Hydractinia feed on smaller invertebrates found in the shallow mud, however in laboratory environments they are fed brine shrimp.  Hydractinia symbiolongicurpus and its sibling species, Hydractinia echinata, are the two species from the genus Hydractinia on which most work has been published.
