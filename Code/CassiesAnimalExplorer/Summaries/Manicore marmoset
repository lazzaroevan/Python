The Manicore marmoset (Mico manicorensis) is a marmoset species endemic to Brazil. It was discovered in the Campos Amaz√¥nicos National Park, less than 200 miles (320 km) from Manaus, near the Madeira River.  Its body is light grey, with orange legs, a black tail, a pinkish face, and naked ears. It is about 9 inches (23 cm) long, excluding the tail, and it has a 15-inch (38 cm) long tail. It weighs about 12 ounces (340 g).
Its validity as a species is questionable; a review found no differences between the Manicore marmoset and Marca's marmoset (M. marcai) of the same region, leading the IUCN to treat the former as a synonym of the latter.
