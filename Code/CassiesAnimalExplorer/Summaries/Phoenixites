Phoenixites is an early (Late Devonian) genus of the Falcitornoceratinae, a subfamily of the goniatitid Tornoceratidae family. This genus was named by Becker in 1995. The type species is "Tornoceras" frechi.
The shell of Phoenixites is discoidal, on which constrictions may be present.  Growth lines are strongly biconvex in juvenile stages, later with shallow a lateral sinus.
Phoenixites may have contained the ancestor of Falcitornoceras which likely gave rise to Gundolficeras, all members of the Falcitornoceratinae.
