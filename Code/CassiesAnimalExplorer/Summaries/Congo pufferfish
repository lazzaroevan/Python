The Congo puffer or potato puffer (Tetraodon miurus) is a freshwater pufferfish found in areas of the Congo River in Africa, including rapids.
The T.miurus populations in the wild are still healthy in suitable habitats and it is considered 'Least Concern' by the IUCNTetraodon miurus can grow to an approximate  length of 15 cm.They are inactive fishes, spending most of their time buried in sand or other substrate, with the ability to adapt their colouration to hide from potential prey.  However, many colour variations are seen within the species, ranging from black to sandy to bright red. It will not change to blue, though, but if in a dark substrate will generally become darker in color.
Like all members of the genus Tetraodon, the Congo puffer is capable of inflating itself with water or air when stressed or otherwise frightened.
