The duckbill pugolovka (Anatirostrum profundorum) is a species of gobiid fish endemic to the southern part of the Caspian Sea. It is characterized by its special flattened and elongated head that resembles a duck's bill. It is the only known species in its genus.It was initially found in 1904 at a depth of 294 metres (965 ft) (arguably 447 m). Only recently more samples of this species have been collected from Iranian waters, where it mainly lives at 50â€“100 m depth. The fish are on average 8 centimetres (3.1 in) long and at maximum 13 cm.
