Thanatus is a genus of false crab spiders described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1837, belonging to the order Araneae, family Philodromidae.
Species of this genus are present in most of Europe.
Adult members of this genus of spiders can reach 5–6 millimetres (0.20–0.24 in) in length and can mostly be encountered above the soil surface (epigeal organism) on low vegetation.
The members of this genus have a clear leaf-like cardiac mark on the anterior dorsal elongated abdomen. They are very similar to Philodromus species, but they can mainly be distinguished by differences in the eyes.
