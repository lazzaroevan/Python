The leafy klipfish (Smithichthys fucorum) is a species of clinid found along the coast of South Africa from Cape Point to the Bashee River.  Its preferred habitat is amongst seaweed in the subtidal zone.  It can reach a maximum total length of 30 cm (12 in).  It is currently the only known member of its genus. The generic name honours the South African ichthyologist J.L.B. Smith  (1897-1968), while the specific name means belonging to the brown seaweed genus Fucus, a reference to its habitat, colouring, and form.
