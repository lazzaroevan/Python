The forewings are light brownish-ochreous, irregularly suffused with ochreous-whitish. There are two small black spots on the costa towards the base and a blackish longitudinal mark in the disc near the base, as well as a straight rather oblique thick blackish bar from the costa at two-fifths, reaching more than half across the wing, followed by an ochreous-whitish bar. The space between these blackish markings is suffused with fuscous. The posterior half of the costa is blackish-fuscous spotted with ochreous-whitish and there is a small black spot in disc at two-thirds, more or less distinctly bisected by a projection from an ochreous-whitish spot beneath it. The hindwings are whitish-grey.
