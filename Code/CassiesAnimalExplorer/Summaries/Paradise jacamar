The paradise jacamar (Galbula dea) is a small, approximately 30 cm (1 ft) long bird with a long pointed tail, dark brown cap, white throat and long needle-like bill. It has dark greenish blue plumage with iridescent wings. Both sexes are similar.
The paradise jacamar is distributed throughout tropical rainforests and savanna of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and the Guyanas. Its range encompasses nearly the entire Amazon Basin, except in the northwest basin in parts of Colombia and Venezuela, (the northeast is the three countries of the Guyanas, which drain to the Atlantic-Caribbean). The diet consists mainly of butterflies and other flying insects.
Widespread and common throughout its range, the paradise jacamar is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
