Gekkota is an infraorder of squamate reptiles in the suborder Scleroglossa, comprising all geckos and the limbless  "snake-lizards" of family Pygopodidae. The legless lizards of the family Dibamidae, also referred to as blind lizards, have occasionally been counted as gekkotans, but recent molecular phylogenies suggest otherwise.
