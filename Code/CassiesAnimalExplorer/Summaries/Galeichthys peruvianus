Galeichthys peruvianus is a species of sea catfish that is found in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru. They reach a length of 35 cm. They are a component of commercial fisheries for human consumption. As with many species in this family, the dorsal fin spines are venomous and any wounds inflicted by them warrant prompt treatment.
