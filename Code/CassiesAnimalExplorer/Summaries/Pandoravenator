Pandoravenator (meaning "Pandora hunter", after the type locality, "Caja de Pandora", i.e. Pandora's box) is a genus of basal tetanuran theropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian to Tithonian) of central Patagonia (Chubut Province). Fossils (in the form of a fragmentally preserved postcranial skeleton) of this dinosaur were discovered in the sediments of the Cañadón Calcáreo Formation and were scientifically described in 2017 by paleontologists Oliver Rauhut and Diego Pol. The type and only known species is Pandoravenator fernandezorum.
