Lycaste is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is known from South America. Callicolaspis was formerly considered a synonym of the genus, but in 2003 Callicolaspis was restored as a separate genus.According to Jan BezdÄ›k (2020), Lycaste was actually an unnecessary new replacement name for Chalcophana, rather than a separate valid genus. Additionally, it is a junior homonym of Lycaste Gistel, 1834 in Buprestidae (a synonym of Polycesta), and Lycaste Agassiz, 1846 in Crustacea (an emendation of Lycesta Savigny, 1816, which is a synonym of Leucothoe).
