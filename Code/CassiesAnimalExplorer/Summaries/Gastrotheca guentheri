Gastrotheca guentheri (common names: Guenther's marsupial frog, dentate marsupial frog) is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae.
It is found in the Andes of Colombia (Cordillera Occidental and Colombian Massif) and Ecuador (Cordillera Occidental). Gastrotheca guentheri is the only known frog with true teeth in both of its jaws, as indicated by the name of the genus it originally typified, Amphignathodon, described by George Albert Boulenger in 1882.
