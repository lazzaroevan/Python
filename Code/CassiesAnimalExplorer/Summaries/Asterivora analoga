Asterivora analoga is a moth of the family Choreutidae. It is endemic to New Zealand.The wingspan is 8â€“9 mm. The head is dark fuscous, the face and sides of the crown are irrorated (speckled) with white. The antennae are dark fuscous dotted with white. The thorax is dark fuscous, somewhat sprinkled with white. The abdomen is dark fuscous, although the segmental margins are strongly white. The dark bronzy-fuscous forewings are rather elongate-triangular and the costa is gently arched, the apex obtuse and the termen slightly rounded and somewhat oblique. There are three curved cloudy transverse lines of white irroration on the anterior half and a white line beyond the middle forming a quadrangular loop behind a transverse-linear white discal mark. The upper side of the loop is silvery-metallic and there is a silvery-metallic dot on the upper extremity of the dorsal segment. The hindwings are fuscous, becoming dark fuscous posteriorly. There is a very short white detached transverse mark before the middle of the termen, and sometimes a dot on the tornus.
