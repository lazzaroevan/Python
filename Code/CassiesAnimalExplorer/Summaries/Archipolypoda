Archipolypoda is an extinct group of millipedes known from fossils in Europe and North America and containing the earliest known land animals.  The Archipolypoda was erected by Scudder (1882) but redefined in 2005 with the description of several new species from Scotland. Distinguishing characteristics include relatively large eyes with densely packed ocelli (sometimes interpreted as compound eyes), and modified leg pairs on the 8th body ring. Some species had prominent spines while others had a flattened appearance.
