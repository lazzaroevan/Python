Atelopus pachydermus is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is found in the Andes of northern Peru (Amazonas and Cajamarca Regions) and southern Ecuador (Zamora-Chinchipe Province). Records from Colombia reflect the vagueness of the stated type locality, "Neu-Granada", encompassing territory part of several present-day countries. Other records outside the current range refer to other species. The most recent record of this very rare and possibly extinct species is from around 1995. However, there is a need to reassess the status of this species because of confusion with Atelopus podocarpus.
