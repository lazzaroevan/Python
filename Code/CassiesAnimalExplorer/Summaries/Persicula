Persicula is a taxonomic genus of minute to small predatory sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks.  It includes several species which are micromollusks.This genus is placed in the family Cystiscidae. It was previously in the family Marginellidae the margin snails. Both families are within the clade Neogastropoda.
(Note: Gastropod taxonomy has been in flux for more than half a century, and this is especially true currently, because of new research in molecular phylogeny. Because of all the ongoing changes, different reliable sources can yield very different classifications.)
