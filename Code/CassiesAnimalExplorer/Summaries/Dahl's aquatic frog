Dahl's aquatic frog (Ranoidea dahlii) is a species of frog in the family Pelodryadinae. It is endemic to Australia.
Its natural habitats are dry savanna, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, freshwater lakes, intermittent freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, and intermittent freshwater marshes.
Dahl's aquatic frog was once thought to be able to consume the eggs, tadpoles and young of the invasive and venomous cane toad with no apparent ill effect, but this observation was based on a handful of captive survivals. Adults will regurgitate the young toads, and avoid eating them in future, or rarely swallow them; in this case, about half the adults will die. These frogs do not appear to have an elevated resistance to bufotoxins compared to other Australian hylid frogs, and avoid these toads if they survive their first toad meal.
