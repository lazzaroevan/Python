The ashy-headed goose  (Chloephaga poliocephala) is a large sheldgoose, which breeds in mountainous areas of southernmost South America and winters on lowlands just north of its breeding range.
The lined nest is built in tall grass, and 4â€“6 eggs are laid. This terrestrial species favours damp upland forest clearings and feeds by grazing; it rarely swims.
