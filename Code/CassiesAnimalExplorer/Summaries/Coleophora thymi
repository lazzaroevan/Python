Coleophora thymi is a moth of the family Coleophoridae. It is found from Germany to Italy and Greece.
The larvae feed on Thymus species. They create a trivalved tubular silken case of 8–9.5 mm with a mouth angle of about 30°. The case is light brown and has a number of indistinct length lines. The mines are quite small at first, but later the leaves are completely mined out. Larvae can be found from autumn to June.
