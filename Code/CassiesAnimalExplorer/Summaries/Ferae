Ferae [ FEER-ee, Latin: [ˈfɛrae̯]] ("wild beasts") is a clade of mammals, consisting of the orders Carnivora (wolves, cats, seals, and so on; over 260 species around the globe) and Pholidota (eight species of pangolins in tropical Africa and Asia). An alternate name, Ostentoria, has also been proposed for a grouping of the Carnivora and Pholidota. The last common ancestor of extant Ferae is supposed to have diversified ca. 78.9 million years ago. Several extinct orders such as creodonts are members of Ferae as well.
