Hoplias aimara, also known as anjumara, traira, trahira, manjuma, anjoemara and wolf fish, is a species of freshwater fish found in the rivers of South America. In Amazonia, the native populations are concerned by high levels of mercury contamination which has been linked to the consumption of contaminated fish. H. aimara is a good bioindicator of such contamination.
