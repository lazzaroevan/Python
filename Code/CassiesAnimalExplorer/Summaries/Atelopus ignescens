Atelopus ignescens, the Jambato toad or Quito stubfoot toad, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to the northern Andes of Ecuador. This once abundant species was believed to be extinct until its rediscovery in 2016. The specific name ignescens means "to catch fire", presumably in reference to the orange ventral color of this species.
