[('Astyanax (fish)', 'Astyanax is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Characidae of the order Characiformes. Some of these fish, like many of their relatives, are kept as aquarium pets and known collectively as tetras. With around 150 described species and new ones being described yearly, this genus is among the largest of the entire order; Hyphessobrycon also has more than 145 species and which one is larger at any one time depends on whether more species have been recently described in one or the other. The blind and colorless cave tetra of Mexico is a famous member of the genus, but its taxonomic position is disputed: Some recognize it as part of the Mexican tetra (A. mexicanus) and this is supported by phylogenetic evidence, but others recognize the cave form as a separate species, A. jordani.The type species is A. argentatus, now regarded as a form of the Mexican tetra (A. mexicanus). The generic name comes from Astyanax, a character in Greek mythology, who was the son of Hector of Troy; in homage to this, several specific epithets also refer to the Iliad.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Mexican_Tetra_%28Astyanax_mexicanus%29_%282687270083%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Astyanax jordani', 'Astyanax jordani  is a freshwater fish of the characin family (family Characidae) of\norder Characiformes, native to Mexico. It is sometimes called the cave tetra, or by its local Spanish name tetra ciego.\nA blind cave fish, A. jordani is very closely related to the Mexican tetra (A. mexicanus) and their taxonomy is disputed. Some treat the two as variants of a single species (in which case A. jordani is a junior synonym of A. mexicanus) and this is supported by phylogenetic evidence, but others continue to recognize the two as separate species.A. jordani is listed on the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable on the basis of shrinking population and an acutely restricted and diminishing habitat. It is fairly resilient, however, having a population doubling time of 15 months.It reportedly has been introduced to the Philippines.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Status_iucn3.1_EN.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Astyanax_jordani_T%C3%A9tra_aveugle_Aquarium_Li%C3%A8ge_30012016_01.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Neonka_obecna_paracheirodon_innesi_whitebackground.jpg']), ('Astyanax microschemos', 'Astyanax microschemos is a species of characid fish from Brazil. It belongs to the A. scabripinnis species complex and differs from other species outside it by having a lower number of branched anal fin rays (about 14-18 vs 20-45) and its shallow body depth being about 26.9-29.7 vs more than 35% of its standard length (SL). Compared to species of its own complex, it can be distinguished by the combination of its shallow body depth (ranging from 26.9-29.7% of SL), and smaller interorbital width (26.9-30.4% of its head length). The species name comes from the Greek mikroschemos, meaning low stature, which refers to the shallow body depth of the animal.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg']), ('Astyanax pelecus', 'Astyanax pelecus is a species of characid fish from Brazil. It can be distinguished from its cogenerate species by: its body depth (26.7-34.8% of its standard length); its short and pointed snout smaller than the orbital diameter; and a reduced number of branched anal fin rays. A. pelecus also differs from members of its genus by its characteristic color pattern. It possesses a single humeral spot that is constricted to the region above the lateral line; at the same time it shows a conspicuous midlateral body stripe from opercle to the caudal fin base, an autapomorphy of this precise species. Most other Astyanax species have a humeral spot that is vertically or horizontally elongate and have the midlateral stripe becoming faint near that humeral spot. The species name is derived from the Greek pelekus, meaning axe, referring to the pigmentation shape resulting from the adjoinment of the humeral spot with the midlateral stripe.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg'])]
