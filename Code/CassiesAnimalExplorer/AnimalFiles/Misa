This stripe is white in the white area, but grey in the black area. The neuration beyond the white area is finely marked out with bluish scales. The basal black area of the hindwings is restricted and followed by a very broad white area. The outer margin is very broadly deep black.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Eudryas_brevipennis_bonneville_female.jpg'])]
