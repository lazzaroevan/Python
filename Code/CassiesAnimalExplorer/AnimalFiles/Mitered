It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Sumatran surili, Presbytis melalophos (as Presbytis melalophos mitrata) but genetic analysis revealed that these are separate species. The mitered langur is native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN due primarily to deforestation, and also due to animals taken for pets.The mitered langur has gray or brown fur on its back, which is darker than on its belly, and the arms, legs and tail are even darker.
