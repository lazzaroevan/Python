[('Kina (animal)', 'Kina (Evechinus chloroticus) is a sea urchin endemic to New Zealand. This echinoderm belongs to the family Echinometridae and it can reach a maximum diameter of 16–17 cm (Barker 2007).\nKina have been a traditional component of Māori diet since pre-European times and has been fished commercially since 1986 in small quantities under the quota management system in restricted areas along the coast of New Zealand (Barker 2007, James et al.2007). Attempts to export E. chloroticus to Asian markets have been unsuccessful, so it may not be an economically attractive species for aquaculture development (James 2003, James 2010).\nEvechinus chloroticus is distributed throughout New Zealand and in some northern and southern offshore islands (Dix 1970a, Barker 2007).\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Sea_urchin%2C_kina%2C_Evechinus_chloroticus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Evechinus_chloroticus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
