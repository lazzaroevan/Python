[('Kermode bear', 'The Kermode bear, sometimes called the spirit bear (Ursus americanus kermodei), is a subspecies of the American black bear and lives in the Central and North Coast regions of British Columbia, Canada. It is the official provincial mammal of British Columbia and symbol of Terrace, British Columbia. While most Kermode bears are black,  between 100 and 500 fully white individuals exist. The white variant is known as spirit bear, and is most common on three islands in British Columbia (Gribbell, Princess Royal, and Roderick), where they make up 10â€“20% of the Kermode population.  Spirit bears hold a prominent place in the oral traditions of the indigenous peoples of the area. They have also been featured in a National Geographic documentary.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Spiritbear.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Ursus_americanus_kermodei%2C_Spirit_Bear_Lodge%2C_Klemtu%2C_BC_2.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Ursus_americanus_kermodei%2C_Great_Bear_Rainforest_1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
