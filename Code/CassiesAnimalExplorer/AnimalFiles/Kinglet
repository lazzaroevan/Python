[('Kinglet', 'A kinglet or crest is a small bird in a group that is sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but is frequently placed in its own family, Regulidae, because of resemblance to titmice.  Regulidae is derived from the Latin word regulus for petty king or prince, and refers to the coloured crowns of adult birds. This family has representatives in North America and Eurasia. There are seven species in this family; one, the Madeira firecrest, Regulus madeirensis, was only recently split from common firecrest as a separate species. One species, the ruby-crowned kinglet, differs sufficiently in its voice and plumage to occasionally be afforded its own genus, Corthylio.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Regulus_ignicapilla_Arundel.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Regulus_calendula1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/RegulusGoodfellowiLodge.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Regulus_regulus_1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Madeiran-Firecrest1-B.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Regulus_regulus_japonensis_face.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Regulus_satrapa_0624_%28cropped%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Kinglet calyptura', 'The kinglet calyptura (Calyptura cristata) is a small passerine bird. It is the only member of the genus Calyptura in the family Tyrannidae. It had traditionally been considered a member of the family Cotingidae.\nIt is endemic to Atlantic forest in south-eastern Brazil. For a long time this species was feared to be extinct, as it went unrecorded during the 20th century until two birds were observed in Serra dos Órgãos on several days in October 1996. Since these sightings, there have not been any confirmed records, although at least one recent—but unconfirmed—record exists from near Ubatuba. Consequently, it is considered Critically Endangered by BirdLife International.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Status_iucn3.1_CR.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Calyptura_cristata.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Kinglet_Calyptura.jpg']), ('Kinglet manakin', 'The kinglet manakin or eastern striped manakin (Machaeropterus regulus) is a small South American species of passerine bird in the manakin family Pipridae. It is found in the Atlantic Forest of south eastern Brazil. It was formerly considered conspecific with the striolated manakin (Machaeropterus striolatus) with the common name striped manakin. Males have a bright red crown, which the females lack.\nThe kinglet manakin was described by the German zoologist Carl Wilhelm Hahn in 1819 and given the binomial name Pipra regulus. The species is now placed in the genus Machaeropterus that was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The species is monotypic.Like many other manakins, the males cluster in a leks to attract females.  After mating, the females rear the chicks on without the help of the males.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Manacus_candei1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Machaeropterus_regulus_-_Stripped_manakin_%28male%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
