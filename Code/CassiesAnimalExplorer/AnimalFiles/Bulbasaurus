[('Bulbasaurus', 'Bulbasaurus (meaning bulbous reptile) is an extinct genus of dicynodont that is known from the Lopingian epoch of the Late Permian period of what is now South Africa, containing the type and only species B. phylloxyron. It was formerly considered as belonging to Tropidostoma; however, due to numerous differences from Tropidostoma in terms of skull morphology and size, it has been reclassified the earliest known member of the family Geikiidae, and the only member of the group known from the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone. Within the Geikiidae, it has been placed close to Aulacocephalodon, although a more basal position is not implausible.\nBulbasaurus was not directly named after the Pokémon Bulbasaur, but rather after its nasal bosses, which are unusually bulbous among geikiids; however, the describers noted that the similarity in name may not be entirely coincidental. Additionally, the specific name of the type species means leaf razor (similar to the Pokémon move Razor Leaf, a technique Bulbasaur can learn), which is most directly a reference to its keratin-covered jaws. Other distinguishing characteristics of Bulbasaurus among the geikiids include the hook-like beak, very large tusks, and absence of bossing on the prefrontal bone.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Lystrosaurus_BW.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Bulbasaurus_SAM-PK-K10587.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Lisowicia_bojani_J..png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Diictodon-A72-01.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Galepus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/GeikiaDB17.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Bulbasaurus-5.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Bulbasaurus-1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bulbasaurus-4.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Endothiodon12DB.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Diictodon_EF.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Bulbasaurus-7.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Bulbasaurus-6.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Bulbasaurus_skull.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Bulbasaurus-13.jpg'])]
