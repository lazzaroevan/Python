They are nocturnal, arboreal, insectivorous lizards, found in primary and secondary forest, as well as degraded habitats.

It is the first addition to the Geckolepis genus since 1942. This species of gecko has the largest scales of any known gecko and can detach them as a defence mechanism when a predator attacks, leaving the predator with a mouthful of scales rather than itself; a character it shares with all other members of the genus Geckolepis. Its scales were reported to come away with greater ease than its congeners.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Geckolepis_megalepis.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Gekko_%28PSF%29.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
