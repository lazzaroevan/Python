They are an active and arboreal species, and should only be kept in a medium to large size vivarium, with plenty of limbs and ledges in which to seek elevation. They can be fed on a variety of domestically bred insects, and need a bowl of water to bathe in.  The Japalura tree dragon, like many arboreal lizard species, will drink from water droplets found on leaves, often from rain or dew, so they will require a drip or misting system to stimulate this in captivity. In the wild, these lizards will also bask to absorb heat and ultraviolet radiation from the sun, so sufficient lighting should be provided in a captive environment to replicate this. Tree dragons are typically not territorial towards other lizards, although males should never be kept together, and they are very dominant feeders due to their voracious appetite, which may present additional hassles when they are kept in a communal setting. They are not aggressive towards humans, however, they may be skittish and attempt to flee. This may make handling a difficulty due to their speed.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Al-Japalura_01.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Al-Japalura_02.jpg']), ('Diploderma swild', 'Diploderma swild, the Swild mountain dragon, is a species of lizard, which was first identified in China in 2019.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Draco_timoriensis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Diploderma swinhonis', Diploderma swinhonis, also known commonly as the Taiwan japalure, Swinhoe's japalure, Swinhoe's lizard, and Swinhoe's tree lizard (Chinese: 斯文豪氏攀木蜥蜴), is a species of lizard in the family Agamidae.
