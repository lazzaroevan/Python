Originally described as a separate species related to Aberdare Mountains African mole-rat, (T. audax) in 1910, some classify it as the same species as the East African mole-rat, (T. splendens).\nIt is a very large, brownish species, with head and body length ranging from 222 to 268 mm (8.7 to 10.6 in). The young are dark with irregular white patches on their underparts. The animal builds large burrows and perhaps associated mounds and eats plant roots.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Tachyoryctes_rex.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Tachyoryctes_rex_hair.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg']), ('King George whiting', The King George whiting (Sillaginodes punctatus), also known as the spotted whiting or spotted sillago, is a coastal marine fish of the smelt-whitings family Sillaginidae. The King George whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the south coast of the country from Jurien Bay, Western Australia to Botany Bay, New South Wales in the east. The King George whiting is the only member of the genus Sillaginodes and the largest member of the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae, growing to a length of 80 cm Todd lambert has proof cm and 4.8 kg in weight. The species is readily distinguishable from other Australian whitings by its unique pattern of spots, as well as its highly elongate shape. King George whiting are often found in bays and protected waterways over sand and seagrass beds, also venturing out onto deep continental shelf reefs during adulthood. The species is a benthic carnivore, consuming a variety of crustaceans, polychaete worms, molluscs and fish. The King George whiting forms the basis of one of southern Australia's most important commercial fisheries, reportedly worth over five million Australian dollars per year. The species is also heavily targeted by recreational anglers, who value the whiting for its sporting and eating qualities., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Sillaginodes_punctatus_juvenile.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/17_Mt_Dutton_Bay_01.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/KG_whiting_World_Distribution_Map.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg']), ('King Island emu', The King Island emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae minor) is an extinct subspecies of emu that was endemic to King Island, in the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may be an example of insular dwarfism. The King Island emu was the smallest of all known emus and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. It was black and brown and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) in a number of osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.\nEuropeans discovered the King Island emu in 1802 during early expeditions to the island, and most of what is known about the bird in life comes from an interview French naturalist François Péron conducted with a sealer there, as well as depictions by artist Charles Alexandre Lesueur. They had arrived on King Island in 1802 with Nicolas Baudin's expedition, and in 1804 several live and stuffed King and Kangaroo Island emus were sent to France. The two live King Island specimens were kept in the Jardin des Plantes, and the remains of these and the other birds are scattered throughout various museums in Europe today. The logbooks of the expedition did not specify from which island each captured bird originated, or even that they were taxonomically distinct, so their status remained unclear until more than a century later. Hunting pressure and fires started by early settlers on King Island likely drove the wild population to extinction by 1805. The captive specimens in Paris both died in 1822 and are believed to have been the last of their kind., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Centenaire_de_la_fondation_du_Mus%C3%A9um_d%27histoire_naturelle_10_juin_1793_-_10_juin_1893_-_volume_comm%C3%A9moratif_%281893%29_%2819965217444%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Baudin_emus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Dromaius_novaehollandiae_minor_Zooth%C3%A8que_MNHN.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Freycinet_Australian_birds.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Lesueur_Emu.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Dromaius_distribution.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Malmaison_animals.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Emu_skulls.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Elephant_seals_on_King_Island.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Emu_size.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/King_Island_Emu_skeleton.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Status_iucn3.1_EX.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg']), ('King Kong (2005 video game)', Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie (also known as Peter Jackson's King Kong, or simply King Kong) is a 2005 action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft, based on the 2005 film King Kong. The game was created in collaboration between the film's director Peter Jackson and the game's director Michel Ancel. The game follows New York scriptwriter Jack Driscoll through Skull Island, as he attempts to save love interest Ann Darrow who has been sacrificed by the island's natives to the giant gorilla Kong.\nThe game allows players to play as both Jack Driscoll and King Kong. Players use firearms and spears as Jack; and punch, grab and use objects/corpses as Kong, to defend against and fight creatures on Skull Island. The King Kong segments are played from a third-person perspective, while the Jack levels are played from a first-person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a heads-up display, with the developers explaining that this conceivably would help players to get further immersed into the game (although the HUD can be turned on in the settings).\nIt was released on PC and sixth generation platforms and a Nintendo DS version on November 21, 2005, while it was released on November 22, 2005, on the Xbox 360 as a launch title, as well as a Game Boy Advance version titled Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World; also, a PlayStation Portable version was released December 20, 2005. The film's cast members reprise their roles.\nUpon release, the console and PC versions received critical acclaim, with critics praising the game's immersive environments and audio, ability to play as both Driscoll and Kong throughout the game, the voice acting (particulary Jack Black's performance), and is often considered one of the best movie based video games of all time. However, the DS version received negative reception due to bugs, poor AI and technical issues, while the PSP version received mixed reviews, with critics liking the inclusion of a multiplayer mode, but criticizing the shorter campaign length., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Star_empty.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Star_full.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Star_half.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/King-kong-cover-pc.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg']), ('King Kong grosbeak', 'The King Kong grosbeak or giant grosbeak (Chloridops regiskongi) is a prehistoric species of Hawaiian honeycreeper, that was endemic to Hawaiʻi.

Despite its common name, it is a member of the genus Pseudechis (black snakes) and only distantly related to true brown snakes. Its alternative common name is the mulga snake, although it lives in many habitats apart from mulga. First described by the English zoologist John Edward Gray in 1842, it is a robust snake up to 3.3 m (11 ft) long. It is variable in appearance, with individuals from northern Australia having tan upper-parts, while those from southern Australia are dark brown to blackish. Sometimes it is seen in a reddish-green texture. The dorsal scales are two-toned, sometimes giving the snake a patterned appearance. Its underside is cream or white, often with orange splotches. The species is oviparous. The snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though may have declined with the spread of the cane toad.\nThe venom is not as potent as those of Australia's other dangerous snakes but can still cause severe effects if delivered in large enough quantities. Its main effect is on striated muscle tissue, causing paralysis from muscle damage, and also commonly affects blood clotting (coagulopathy). There is often extensive pain and swelling, and rarely necrosis, at the bite site. Deaths from its bites have been recorded, with the most recent being in 1969.

This ancestry is supported by several anatomical peculiarities which are present only in king crabs and hermit crabs. Although some doubt still exists about this theory, king crabs are the most widely quoted example of carcinisation among the Decapoda. The evidence for this explanation comes from the asymmetry of the king crab's abdomen, which is thought to reflect the asymmetry of hermit crabs, which must fit into a spiral shell., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Spiny_king_crab_md.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/The_Childrens_Museum_of_Indianapolis_-_Alaskan_red_king_crab.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/King_crab_in_Kirkenes.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/CSIRO_ScienceImage_2839_Spiny_Stone_King_Crab.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Charybdis_japonica.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('King dory', 'The king dory or lookdown dory (Cyttus traversi) is a dory, in the genus Cyttus, found around South Africa, southern Australia, and New Zealand, over the continental shelf at depths of between 200 and 800 m.

It is quite common in aviculture worldwide, where it is sometimes misleadingly known as the button quail, which is the name of an only very distantly related family of birds, the buttonquails.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Caille_de_Chine_MHNT.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Blue-breasted_Quail_Samcem_oct04.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Excalfactoria_chinensis_%28aka%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Coturnix_chinensis_Bruggen.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/King_quail_eggs_and_baby_bird%2810days%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']), ('King rail', 'The king rail (Rallus elegans) is a waterbird, the largest North American rail.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Blending_in.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Status_iucn3.1_NT.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/KingRail23.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Rallus_elegans_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/King_Rail_and_young_%288424334695%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg']), ('King Rat (film)', King Rat is a 1965 American war film written and directed by Bryan Forbes and starring George Segal and James Fox.

The head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.\nKing vultures were popular figures in the Mayan codices as well as in local folklore and medicine.
