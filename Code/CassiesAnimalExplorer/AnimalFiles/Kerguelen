[('Kerguelen petrel', 'The Kerguelen petrel (Aphrodroma brevirostris) is a small (36 cm long) slate-grey seabird in the family Procellariidae. The species has been described as a taxonomic oddball, being placed for a long time in Pterodroma (the gadfly petrels) before being split out in 1942 into its own genus Aphrodroma. The position within the procellariids is still a matter of debate; when it was split away from the Pterodroma petrels it was suggested that it may be a fulmarine petrel, whereas a 1998 study placed the species close to the shearwaters and the genus Bulweria.Kerguelen petrels breed colonially on remote islands; colonies are present on Gough Island in the Atlantic Ocean, and Marion Island, Prince Edward Island, Crozet Islands and Kerguelen Island in the Indian Ocean. The species attends its colonies nocturnally, breeding in burrows in wet soil. The burrows usually face away from the prevailing wind. A single egg is laid per breeding season; the egg is unusually round for the family.  The egg is incubated by both parents for 49 days. After hatching the chick fledges after 60 days.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/LugensaBrevirostris.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Aphrodroma_MHNT.zoo.2010.11.43.24.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Flag_of_the_French_Southern_and_Antarctic_Lands.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Short-tailed_Albatross_%28Phoebastria_albatrus%29.jpg']), ('Kerguelen shag', 'The Kerguelen shag (Leucocarbo verrucosus) is a species of cormorant endemic to the Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the most isolated places on Earth.

However, smaller colonies are also found in the Prince Edward Islands (i.e. Prince Edward and Marion) and Crozet Islands. The total number of individuals is from 3,500–6,500 birds, although there is no recent data from the main colony at Kerguelen. These birds do not inhabit Kerguelen proper, instead nesting on islets free of feral cats. During bad weather, they are known to abandon their colonies.\nKerguelen terns are among the least-ranging of all typical terns. They generally do not reach far into the seas near their breeding grounds.\nThese birds eat fish and marine invertebrates, especially those found in beds of the seaweed Macrocystis spp. They sometimes also hunt insects on land and catch fish from rivers on Kerguelen.\nThere are two subspecies:\nS. v. mercuri (Voisin, 1971) – Crozet and Prince Edward Islands\nS. v. virgata (Cabanis, 1875) – Kerguelen Island', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Sterne_de_Kerguelen.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Crestedauklet41.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Status_iucn3.1_NT.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Flag_of_the_French_Southern_and_Antarctic_Lands.svg'])]
