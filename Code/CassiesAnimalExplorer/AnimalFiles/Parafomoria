There is probably one generation per year.\nThe larvae feed on Cistus ladanifer, Cistus laurifolius, Cistus monspeliensis, Cistus populifolius and Cistus salviifolius. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long, often contorted, narrow corridor that hardly widens towards the end. The frass is deposited in an interrupted central line that never occupies over one third of the corridor width.
