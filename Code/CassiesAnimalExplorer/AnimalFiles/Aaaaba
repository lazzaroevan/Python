[('Aaaaba', 'Aaaaba is a genus of beetles from the Buprestidae family. It inhabits locations along the east coast of Australia. It was described in 1864 by Achille Deyrolle as Alcinous, a junior homonym of a genus of pycnogonids. In 2002, Charles Bellamy gave it the replacement name Aaaba, but this proved to be another junior homonym, of a genus of sponges. In 2013, it was given a further replacement name, becoming Aaaaba.There are two species within this genus:\n\nAaaaba nodosa (Deyrolle, 1865)\nAaaaba fossicollis (Kerremans, 1903)The genus name is feminine under ICZN Article 30.2.4 (If no gender was specified or indicated, the name is to be treated as masculine, except that, if the name ends in -a the gender is feminine).', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Aaaaba_nodosus_%28reflected%29.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Chrysochroa_rajah_thailandica_MHNT.ZOO.2004.0.520.jpg'])]
