[('Chestnut-quilled rock pigeon', 'The chestnut-quilled rock pigeon (Petrophassa rufipennis) is a dark sooty brown pigeon with a distinctive bright chestnut patch on its wing visible in flight. It has distinctive pale lines across its face curving above and below its eye. A species of bird in the family Columbidae, it is very similar in behaviour and habitat to the white-quilled rock pigeon but it is only found on rocky escarpments in western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/PetrophassaRufipennisKeulemans.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
