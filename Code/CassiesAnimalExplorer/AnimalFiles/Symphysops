[('Symphysops', 'Symphysops is a genus of trilobites of average size, belonging to the Cyclopygidae family. It had a cosmopolitan distribution and lived from the Middle to the Upper Ordovician (Llanvirn to Ashgill). It has been found in Canada (Quebec and Newfoundland), China, the Czech Republic (Bohemia), Iran, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Poland, Morocco, Spain, Scotland and Wales. The name Symphysops refers to the fused eyes, common to the species of this genus. Some (sub)species of the cyclopygid genera Cyclopyge and Pricyclopyge share this character, but Symphysops uniquely combines the merged eye with a frontal thorn on the head and the lower eyelid.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Allosaurus_Jardin_des_Plantes.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Symphysopsis_eyes_oblique.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Symphysopsis_eyes_frontal.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Cyclopigid_cephalon_lateral_CRF.jpg'])]
