[('Kihnichthys', Kihnichthys ufermanni, the Usumacinta cichlid, is a species of cichlid found in the Pasión River system, a tributary to the Usumacinta River in Petén, Guatemala. This species is the only known member of its genus, but several of its features, including the chisel-like teeth, are shared with Cincelichthys and whether they should be merged into a single genus is not yet fully resolved.The generic name honours the Guatemalan ichthyologist Herman A. Kihn while the specific name honours the German aquarist, and friend of Robert Allgayer's, Alfred Ufermann who died in 2000., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Sagalgm0.png'])]
