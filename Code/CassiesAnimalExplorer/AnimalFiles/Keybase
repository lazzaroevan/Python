[('Keybase', 'Keybase is a key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys (including, but not limited to PGP keys) in a publicly auditable manner. Additionally it offers an end-to-end encrypted chat and cloud storage system, called Keybase Chat and the Keybase Filesystem respectively. Files placed in the public portion of the filesystem are served from a public endpoint, as well as locally from a filesystem mounted by the Keybase client.Keybase supports publicly connecting Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Hacker News, and Mastodon identities, including websites and domains under one\'s control, to encryption keys. It also supports Bitcoin, Zcash, and Stellar wallet addresses. Keybase has supported Coinbase identities since initial public release, but ceased to do so on March 17, 2017 when Coinbase terminated public payment pages. In general, Keybase allows for any service with public identities to integrate with Keybase.On May 7, 2020, Keybase announced it had been acquired by Zoom, as part of Zoom\'s plan to further strengthen the security of our video communications platform.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Keybase_logo_official.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg'])]
