[('Pyraustinae', Pyraustinae is a large subfamily of the lepidopteran family Crambidae, the crambid snout moths. It currently includes over 1,400 species; most of them tropical but some found in temperate regions including both North America and Europe.\nThe Pyraustinae were originally including the Spilomelinae; the present group was at that time considered a tribe Pyraustini. It has not been fully established yet which taxa of the Pyraustinae sensu lato belong to Pyraustinae as currently understood; thus the number of species in this subfamily is set to increase (although the Spilomelinae are the larger group of the old Pyraustinae).\nTaxonomists' opinions differ as to the correct placement of the Crambidae, some authorities treating them as a subfamily (Crambinae) of the family Pyralidae. If this is done, Pyraustinae is usually treated as a separate subfamily within Pyralidae.\nThe Pyraustinae are characterised by atrophied spinula and venulae in the tympanal organs; a narrow fornix tympani; a longitudinal groove with androconial scales on the male mesothoracic tibiae; an often spinose antrum; and a sella (a medially directed clasper on the inside of the valvae), and an editum with modified setae on the male valvae.\nMany species have larvae that bore into stems and fruit of plants, and several, notably from the genus Ostrinia, are serious agricultural pests.\n\n, ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Saucrobotys_futilalis_adult.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Saucrobotys_futilalis_larva_1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Eurrhypara_hortulata_%28Edkins%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Saucrobotys_futilalis_larvae_web.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Saucrobotys_futilalis_larva_2.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Saucrobotys_futilalis_prepupa.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Saucrobotys_futilalis_pupa.jpg'])]
