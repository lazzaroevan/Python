It is endemic to a small portion of Colombia’s central Andes in Antioquia. The chestnut-capped piha  only lives in a narrow band of humid premontane cloud forest. It is a dark grey passerine with a notable chestnut crown on the upper nape and pale cinnamon-colored undertail coverts. Adults are small for pihas, measuring about 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) long. Males have modified primary feathers with elongated and stiff  barbules that enable them to create a whirring noise with their wings, which the piha likely uses for display purposes. Its call is extremely loud and can be heard over 100 m (330 ft) away. The chestnut-capped piha is mostly frugivorous, although it will eat some invertebrates. Little is known about the species' breeding ecology, although it is believed to be a lekking species.\nThis species was not discovered until 1999 due in large part to the species’ tiny range and political instability in central Colombia. The chestnut-capped piha is critically endangered, and the population may be as low as 250 birds. It is primarily threatened by habitat destruction as its cloud forests are converted into usage for farming, mining, and agriculture. Several reserves have been set up to protect portions of its range; however, more conservation work needs to be done to protect the species from extinction., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Status_iucn3.1_CR.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Chestnut-capped_Piha.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Lipaugus_weberi_%28Chestnut-capped_Piha%29_-_Arriero_Antioque%C3%B1o_%286929394022%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Anor%C3%AD_desde_el_aire.jpg']), ('Chestnut-capped puffbird', 'The chestnut-capped puffbird (Bucco macrodactylus) is a species of bird in the family Bucconidae, the puffbirds.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Chestnut-capped_Puffbird.jpg']), ('Chestnut-capped thrush', 'The chestnut-capped thrush (Geokichla interpres) lives in forests and woodlands of Southeast Asia. It is a songbird species in the family Turdidae. Traditionally, it has included the Enggano thrush as a subspecies, but a recent review recommended treating them as separate. Consequently, the chestnut-capped thrush is monotypic.\nThe chestnut-capped thrush has a black back and a white belly with black spots. As its common name suggests, it has a chestnut cap. Its face is black with a white mark on the cheeks and another on the lores. The superficially similar chestnut-backed thrush is substantially larger when seen alongside one another, and has a black crown and rufous back, whereas the Enggano thrush has an olive-ochre back and little or no white on the lores and auriculars.\nThe chestnut-capped thrush is very rare in zoos. According to ISIS, Chester Zoo had the only female outside of Asia, until she died in 2007. However, small numbers have been held in private European aviaries since the mid-1990s and very small numbers remain as of late 2009.\nIt was formerly classified as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN. New research has shown it to be rarer than previously believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to Near Threatened status in 2008 and once again to Endangered in 2020.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Geokichla_interpres_1838.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Hermitthrush63.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Status_iucn3.1_EN.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
