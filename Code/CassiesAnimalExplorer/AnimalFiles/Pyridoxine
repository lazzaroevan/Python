[(Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase, In enzymology, a pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase (EC 2.6.99.2) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction\n\n1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate + 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate \n  \n    \n      \n        â‡Œ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rightleftharpoons }\n   pyridoxine-5'-phosphate + phosphate + 2 H2OThe two substrates of this enzyme are 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate (HAP), whereas its 3 products are H2O, phosphate, and pyridoxine-5'-phosphate (a vitamer of pyridoxal phosphate)., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Issoria_lathonia.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/PdxJ_mechanism.png'])]
