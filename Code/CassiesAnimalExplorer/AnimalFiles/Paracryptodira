[('Paracryptodira', 'Paracryptodira are an extinct clade of turtles in the  order Testudines. Initially treated as a suborder sister to the Cryptodira, they were then thought to be a very primitive lineage inside the Cryptodira according to the most common use of the latter taxon. They are now considered to be a third fundamental division of the Testudines, alongside Cryptodira and Pleurodira. The paracryptodirian turtles are said to have phylogenic relationships, noted as primary subclades, within the Baenidae and Pleurosternidae. Within each subclade, lies many biodiverse turtles that are continuously being investigated and added to the fossil record.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Chisternon.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Dorsetochelys_skull_Dorset_County_Museum.JPG'])]
