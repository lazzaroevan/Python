[('Sportive lemur', 'The sportive lemurs are the medium-sized primates that make up the family Lepilemuridae. The family consists of only one extant genus, Lepilemur. They are closely related to the other lemurs and exclusively live on the island of Madagascar. For a time, this family was named Megaladapidae, but the current name was given precedence since the extinct genus Megaladapis was removed from the family.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Ankarana_sportive_lemur_%28Lepilemur_ankaranensis%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Lepilemur_randrianasoli_a.PNG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Lepilemur_range_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg'])]
