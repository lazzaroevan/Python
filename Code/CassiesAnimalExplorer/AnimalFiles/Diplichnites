[('Diplichnites', 'Diplichnites are arthropod trackways with two parallel rows of blunt to elongate, closely spaced tracks oriented approximately perpendicularly to the mid-line of the trackway.  The term is more often used for the ichnofossils of this description; however, similar trackways from recent arthropods are sometimes given this name as well.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Diplichnites%2C_Cambrian%2C_Elk_Mound_Group._Blackberry_Hill%2C_WI._Gass%2C_2012.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Diplichnites_mcr1.jpg'])]
