[('Cardinal beetle', The name cardinal beetle typically refers to three different species of beetles. The red-headed or 'common' cardinal beetle (Pyrochroa serraticornis) is a red to orange beetle with, as the name suggests, a red head. It is about 20 millimetres (0.79 in) long, and is found throughout Britain. The rarer black-headed cardinal beetle (P. coccinea), similarly found at sites across Britain, is larger and a deeper blood red. The scarce cardinal beetle (Schizotus pectinicornis) also has a black head, but is smaller at around 9 millimetres (0.35 in) long. The scarce cardinal is only found at a few sites in Scotland and Wales.\n\nCardinal beetles prey on other insects, while their bright red colour prevents them being the target of other predators which believe them to be toxic., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Schizotus_pectinicornis.ogv', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Pyrochroa.coccinea.female.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Pyrochroa_serraticornis02.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg'])]
