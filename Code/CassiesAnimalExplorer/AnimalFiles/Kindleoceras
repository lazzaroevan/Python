[('Kindleoceras', 'Kindleoceras is a genus of oncocerids belonging to the  Valcouroceratidae, extinct nautiloid cephalopods that lived during the Middle and Late Ordovician.\nKindleoceras is characterized by a gently curved or virtually straight shell, the cross section of which is triangular with flattened dorsum and subangular venter.\nThe siphuncle is small, ventral, cyrtochoanitic with outwardly flared necks, thickened rings, and well developed radial internal actinosiphonate deposits.\nIn general form Kindleoceras is similar to Manitoulinoceras except for its triangular cross section. Augustoceras, another valcouroceratid, differs in that the rays in its actinosiphonate deposits are longer but less numerous.\nKindleoceras, named by Foeste, has been found in the Middle and Upper Ordovician of Ontario in Canada.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Aturia_angustata_Lincoln_Creek_formation_01.jpg'])]
