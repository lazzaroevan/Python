[(Kirk's blenny, The Kirk's blenny (Alticus kirkii) is a species of combtooth blenny (family Blenniidae) in the genus Alticus. It was described by A. Günther in 1964, originally as a member of the genus Salarias. It is a tropical blenny which is known from the Red Sea, Mozambique, Réunion, the Persian Gulf, and India, in the Indian ocean. Kirk's blennies inhabit waters near the shore, and often spend time out of the water. They are able to breathe air when on land. They are oviparous, and form distinct pairs when mating; they also guard their eggs. They can reach a maximum total length of 11 centimetres (4.33 inches), and feed primarily off of benthic algae.The common name and the specific name honour the Scottish doctor, naturalist and explorer John Kirk (1832-1922) who collected the type of this species and gave it to the British Museum (Natural History)., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Salarias_kirkii_Ford_69.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Meiacanthus_atrodorsalis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), (Kirk's dik-dik, Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) is a small antelope native to Eastern Africa and one of four species of dik-dik antelope. It is believed to have six subspecies and possibly a seventh existing in southwest Africa. Dik-diks are herbivores, typically of a fawn color that aids in camouflaging themselves in savannah habitats. According to MacDonald (1985), they are also capable of reaching speeds  up to 42 km/hour. The lifespan of Kirk's dik-dik in the wild is typically 5 years, but may surpass 10 years. In captivity, males have been known to live up to 16.5 years, while females have lived up to 18.4 years., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Madoqua_kirkii.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Dik-Dik%2C_family%2C_Lake_Manyara.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Madoqua_kirkii_map.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Dikdik_Looking.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Madoqua_kirkii_-_male_%28Namutoni%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Damara_Dik-Dik.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Madoqua_kirkii_-_female_%28Namutoni%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Dikdik.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), (Kirk's white-eye, Kirk's white-eye (Zosterops kirki) is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae.
