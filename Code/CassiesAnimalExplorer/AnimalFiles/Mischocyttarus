[('Mischocyttarus', 'Mischocyttarus is a very large, primarily Neotropical genus of social wasps with a few species found also in the Nearctic region. It is the only member of the tribe Mischocyttarini; the asymmetrical tarsal lobes of Mischocyttarus separates it from the tribe Epiponini. Mischocyttarus is the largest genus of social wasps, containing over 200 species and subspecies. Mischocyttarus wasps build a relatively simple, single comb nest. Sometimes, the nest is built within a meter of the nest of Polistes carnifex. Foraging adults bring nectar and small caterpillars back to the nest to feed to the developing larvae which are individually housed in separate cells in the nest. Not all nests have a female with developed ovaries. Their biology is similar to that of species in the genus Polistes. However, Mischocyttarus appear to show considerably more social and reproductive flexibility than Polistes.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Wasp_building_nest.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Paper_wasps-huddling.jpeg']), ('Mischocyttarus drewseni', 'Mischocyttarus drewseni, which is sometimes spelled drewsenii, is a social wasp in the family Vespidae. It is commonly found in Neotropical regions of South America, including Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia and Paraguay. This mid-sized wasp is about 1.5-1.8 cm and is typically dark brown or black in color. This species makes their nests out of woody plant fibers and create single combed nests with hexagonal cells which are typically found in low lying grass habitats or semi-urban environments. The colony cycle for this species is initiated by the queen who starts building the nest cell by cell. The nest construction process is highly elaborate and involves foraging for materials, creating cells, and heightening cell walls. It feeds on arthropods, plant nectar, and honeydew, and the species is very protective of its brood when it comes to defending them from their predators. The life cycle of this species has several stages with varying lengths, including egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. As a social wasp species, there are several castes within the colony and different castes perform different specialized jobs with differing dominance and reproductive behaviors.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/7/74/20120404173704%21Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Mischocyttarus flavitarsis', 'Mischocyttarus flavitarsis is a social paper wasp found in western North America. Their nests can be found both in forests close to rivers or in close proximity to human life under the eaves of roofs. Despite the fact that M. flavitarsis nests are frequently in close contact with humans, M. flavitarsis typically will not sting, but rather ram into the threatening individual. Their colony cycle typically begins before May and will last until October. The queen will then seek a hibernation site for the winter. Perched near female hibernation sites are males with whom the female will mate. The males have claimed their territory by rubbing sternal brushes along the border of the site, leaving a chemical that deters other individuals from approaching. M. flavitarsis feed on arthropods, nectar, and animal carcasses and are often prey to birds, ants, and praying mantis.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Mischocyttarus_flavitarsis_Head_Closeup.jpg']), ('Mischocyttarus mexicanus', 'Mischocyttarus mexicanus (de Saussure) is a New World paper wasp  that exhibits facultative eusocial behavior and includes at least two subspecies living in the southern United States and Central America. This social wasp species is a good model for studying the selective advantage of different nesting tactics within a single species. M. mexicanus females can form nests both as individuals and as members of a colony, and are even known to switch between these two nesting strategies throughout their life, which is an unusual phenomenon in the field of social biology. Individuals in a colony have particular social roles that are plastic, as opposed to rigid castes, and brood parasitism and usurpation have been observed between unrelated conspecifics. They nest in a variety of types of plants and human constructions, although they have most frequently been observed in palm trees, and they are known to interact with a number of other species as prey, competitors over resources, or foragers.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Avispa_del_papel-Paper_wasp_%28Polistes_instabilis%29_%287623451086%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Paper_Wasp_-_Mischocyttarus_mexicanus%2C_Crocodile_Lake_National_Wildlife_Refuge%2C_Key_Largo%2C_Florida.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Mischocyttarus.mexicanus_%28cropped%29.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Toxotrypana.curvicauda.png']), ('Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola', 'Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola  is a neotropical paper wasp found in the New World.

This context-dependent trait makes Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola a good model to study social biology within social wasps. In detail, this trait allows for the females of this species to form nests both individually and as co-founders with other females within the same colony. This subspecies is also known to exhibit cannibalism, with M. m. cubicola queens feeding on their own larvae for nourishment when unaided by workers.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Mischocyttarus.mexicanus_%28cropped%29.JPG']), ('Mischocyttarus santacruzi', 'Mischocyttarus santacruzi is a species of social wasp from the Vespidae family.
