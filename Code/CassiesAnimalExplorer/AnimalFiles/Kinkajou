[('Kinkajou', 'The kinkajou (/ˈkɪŋkədʒuː/ KING-kə-joo; Potos flavus) is a tropical rainforest mammal of the family Procyonidae related to olingos, coatis, raccoons, and the ringtail and cacomistle. It is the only member of the genus Potos and is also known as the honey bear (a name that it shares with the unrelated sun bear). Kinkajous are arboreal, a lifestyle they evolved independently; they are not closely related to any other tree-dwelling mammal group (primates, some mustelids, etc.).\nNative to Central America and South America, this mostly frugivorous mammal is not an endangered species, though it is seldom seen by people because of its strict nocturnal habits. However, they are hunted for the pet trade, for their skins (to make wallets and horse saddles) and for their meat. The species has been included in Appendix III of CITES by Honduras, which means that exports from Honduras require an export permit and exports from other countries require a certificate of origin or re-export. They may live up to 40 years in captivity', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Kinkajou_area.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Kinkajou_skull.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Potos_flavus_%288973438737%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Yawning_kinkajou.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Potos_flavus_%28Harvard_University%29_black_background.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Potos_flavus_%288973438561%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
