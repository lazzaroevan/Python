[('Geisonoceratidae', 'Geisonoceratidae is an extinct family of orthoceroid cephalopods endemic to what would be Asia, Europe, and North America from the Middle Ordovician to the Middle Devonian living from about 470â€”380 mya, existing for approximately 90 million years. With the possible addition of an Early Cretaceous orthocerid from the western Caucasus  the range of this group increases dramatically to some 350 million years, thus making it one of the longest lived families of the Nautiloidea.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Allosaurus_Jardin_des_Plantes.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Silurian_Orthoceras_Fossil_Macro_2.JPG'])]
