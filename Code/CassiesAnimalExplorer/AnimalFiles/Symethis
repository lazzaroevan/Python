[('Symethis', 'Symethis is a genus of crabs. It differs from other genera in the family Raninidae by the lack of ornamentation of the male first pleopods and by the reduced number of gills (7 pairs rather than 8 pairs), and is therefore placed in a separate subfamily, Symethinae.There are three extant species:\nSymethis corallica Davie, 1989 – Chesterfield Reefs, Coral Sea \nSymethis garthi Goeke, 1981 – Pacific coast of Panama \nSymethis variolosa (Fabricius, 1793) – western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina, to Bahia, Brazil One further species, Symethis johnsoni is known from fossils of Paleogene age, but may belong in the subfamily Lyreidinae rather than in Symethis.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Crab-icon.png'])]
