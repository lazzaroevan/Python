[('Gavialis bengawanicus', 'Gavialis bengawanicus is an extinct species of crocodilian that is related to the modern Indian gharial. Fossils have been found in Thailand and Indonesia. The type locality is at Trinil.The presence of this species in Thailand may provide an explanation for the distribution of fossil gharials that appears disjunct, covering Pakistan and Java but not the connecting areas. The fossils suggest that gharials may have dispersed from Indo-Pakistan to Indonesia through Thailand without having to resort to marine routes.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Gavialis_bengawanicus_skull.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Batrachotomus_kupferzellensis_2.JPG']), ('Gavialis browni', 'Gavialis browni is an extinct species of the crocodylian genus Gavialis and a close relative of the living gharial Gavialis gangeticus. \nG. browni lived about 5 million years ago in the Sivalik Hills of Pakistan. G. browni can be distinguished from G. gangeticus by its more closely spaced eyes and a narrower frontal bone. The species was named in 1932 by paleontologist Charles Mook. Mook described it as a transitional form between the most primitive Gavialis species, Gavialis dixoni, and the most advanced, the modern gharial (although G. dixoni is now placed outside Gavialis in its own genus, Dollosuchus, and may be more closely related to crocodiles than to the gharial). G. browni has a longer snout with more teeth than Dollosuchus, but it is not as long and does not have as many teeth as that of the gharial. G. browni has also been proposed to be moved to a genus other than Gavialis.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Gavialis_browni_AMNH_6279.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Batrachotomus_kupferzellensis_2.JPG']), ('Gavialis pachyrhynchus', 'Gavialis pachyrhynchus is an extinct species of gavialid from the Miocene of India.  Although only known from fragmentary jaw material, the size of this material is substantially larger than comparable bones in large gharials.A 2018 re-evaluation of the genus Gavialis suggests that G. pachyrhynchus be instead moved under the genus Rhamphosuchus.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Batrachotomus_kupferzellensis_2.JPG'])]
