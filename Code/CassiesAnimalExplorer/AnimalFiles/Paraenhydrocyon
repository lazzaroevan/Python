[('Paraenhydrocyon', 'Paraenhydrocyon (beside Enhydrocyon) is an extinct genus of bone crushing omnivorous early canid which inhabited North America during the Early Miocene, 24.8—20.4 Ma, existing for approximately 5 million years.\nThe dentition suggests that this animal was a hypercarnivore or mesocarnivore. In addition to its retention of several primitive cranial characters, this includes unique sharp-tipped, slender premolars that clearly contrast with the strong premolars of the Mesocyon–Enhydrocyon group, but also parallels that clade by having a reduced metaconid cusp on the lower molars.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Machairodus_from_Cerro_de_Batallones.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Wolf_%28PSF%29_cleaned_2.png'])]
