[('Kiaeria limuloides', 'Kiaeria is a genus of chasmataspidid, a group of extinct aquatic arthropods. It was originally classified as a xiphosuran of the monotypic family Kiaeriidae. However, in 2019, the British geologist and paleobiologist James C. Lamsdell assigned the genus to the order Chasmataspidida, possibly being a member of the family Chasmataspididae. Only one species has been assigned to this genus, K. limuloides.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Allosaurus_Jardin_des_Plantes.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Mixopterus_BW.jpg'])]
