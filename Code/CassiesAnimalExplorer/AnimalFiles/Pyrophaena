[('Pyrophaena', 'Pyrophaena  is a subgenus of the hoverfly genus Platycheirus distinctive enough to sometimes treated as a separate genus in its own right. Indeed a recent study of the phylogeny of the subfamily Syrphinae found it to be closer to other certain other genera â€“ Rohdendorfia, Syrphocheilosia and Spazigaster. Since only a few species were sampled the true systematic structure must await a more thorough survey of Platycheirus and related genera.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Platycheirus_%28Pyrophaena%29_rosarum_-_male.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Volucella_zonaria_MHNT.jpg'])]
