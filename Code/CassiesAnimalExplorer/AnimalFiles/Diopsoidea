[('Diopsoidea', 'The Diopsoidea are a small but diverse cosmopolitan superfamily of acalyptrate muscoids, especially prevalent in the tropics. Some flux exists in the family constituency of this group (e.g., the Megamerinidae are sometimes placed here, but may also be placed in the Nerioidea), and the final classification is likely to require the use of molecular systematics.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Diopsid2.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
