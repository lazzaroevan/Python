[('Pyrophorini', 'The Pyrophorini are a New World taxonomic tribe within the Elateridae (click beetle) subfamily Agrypninae. Pyrophorini is a tribe of bioluminescent beetles, and includes such genera as Pyrophorus and Ignelater.\nIt is believed to be monophyletic.\nThe tribe Anaissini is very closely related to the Pyrophorini (it includes species formerly placed in Pyrophorini); the latter is exclusively bioluminescent, while the former has only some species that are known to be bioluminescent. Another bioluminescent lineage is Campyloxenus pyrothorax (from Chile) in the related monotypic subfamily Campyloxeninae. The Sinopyrophoridae were thought to represent the first bioluminescent click beetles known from Asia, but actually represent an distantly related novel bioluminescent beetle family.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Plectrosternus_WIKI.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Pyrophorus_luminosus.JPG'])]
