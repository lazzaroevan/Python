[('Aaveqaspis', 'Aaveqaspis is a genus of small (about 2.5 centimetres or 1.0 inch long) marine arthropods of unclear affiliation, that lived during the early Cambrian period. Fossil remains of Aaveqaspis were collected from the Lower Cambrian Sirius Passet fossil-Lagerst√§tte of North Greenland. Aaveqaspis looks like a soft eyeless trilobite with a weakly defined axis, a headshield (or cephalon) with stubby genal spines, 5 thorax segments also ending in stubby genal spines, and a tailshield (pygidium) with a pair of massive tusk-like spines, and two smaller spines near the end of the axis. The only species presently known is A. inesoni (i.e. the genus is monotypic).', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Cambrian_explosion_taskforce_logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Aaveqaspis_inesoni.jpg'])]
