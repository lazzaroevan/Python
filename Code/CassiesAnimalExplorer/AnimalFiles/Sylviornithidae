[('Sylviornithidae', 'Sylviornithidae is an extinct family of flightless birds. Traditionally assumed to be within Galliformes, recent phylogenetic studies showcase that they rest outside of the galliform crown-group, making them the most recently lived non-galliform Pangalliformes. For many years it was considered a monotypic family consisting of Sylviornis alone, but recent studies show that Megavitiornis was part of this clade as well.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Sylviornis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b7/Pending-protection-shackle.svg'])]
