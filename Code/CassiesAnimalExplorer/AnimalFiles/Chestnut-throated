[('Chestnut-throated apalis', The chestnut-throated apalis (Apalis porphyrolaema) is a species of bird in the cisticola family Cisticolidae. The Kabobo apalis, originally described as a distinct species, is usually treated as a subspecies A. p. kaboboensis of the chestnut-throated apalis today. It is itself sometimes considered to be the same species as the Chapin's apalis., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Cisticola_exilis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Chestnut-throated_Apalis_-_Uganda_H8O3351_%2816707119014%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Chestnut-throated flycatcher', 'The Chestnut-throated flycatcher (Myiagra castaneigularis) is a species of bird in the monarch-flycatcher family Monarchidae.  The species is endemic to Fiji.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Asian_Paradise_Flycatcher_icon.png']), ('Chestnut-throated huet-huet', The chestnut-throated huet-huet (Pteroptochos castaneus) is a large passerine bird of the family Rhinocryptidae. At an average mass of 165 grams (5.8 oz), it is, with the related black-throated huet-huet, the largest rhinocryptid and the third-heaviest tracheophone suboscine behind the giant and great antpittas. It is a stockily-built bird, averaging 23 centimetres (9.1 in) in length with a predominantly dark brown plumage except for a dark red throat and a pale buff bar on its wind – lacking in the Black-Throated species. For many decades intense debate existed as to whether these two were one species or two, but molecular studies in the 1990s demonstrated that the two species had been separated since before the Patagonian Ice Sheet first formed in southern Chile.The species is found in temperate forest of Nothofagus species and Austrocedrus chilensis on the humid fringe of the Mediterranean climate zone of Chile, chiefly in Biobío, Maule and parts of O'Higgins Regions, and also in a small adjacent area of Neuquén Province in Argentina.\nThe species sometimes occurs in exotic Pinus radiata plantations, but only if there is a dense understory of shrubs, as it cannot move across habitat without dense understory as shown by a study of the fragmented Maulino forest. The Chestnut-Throated Huet-Huet feeds on insects and their larvae, and also a substantial number of seeds and fruit, which it digs for in the forest floor with its long claws. It may be important in the dispersal of certain forest plants.Breeding occurs in spring between September and December, but the burrows ordinarily used to nest are dug during the winter rainy season when the soil is loosest. The burrows can be as much as 3 metres (9.8 ft) deep and contain two oval white eggs, which are very large for the bird's size, typically averaging 35.6 millimetres (1.4 in) long and 27.9 millimetres (1.1 in) wide with a mass of 14 grams (0.5 oz). It is believed both sexes incubate the eggs (as is usual for tracheophone suboscines), but the incubation period is not documented.\nThe huet-huets are well known for their vocalisations, and the song of the chestnut-throated huet-huet is a series of resonant “hoots” that unlike its more southerly counterpart, is typically given as a duet between pairs. The song is higher, softer and faster than the black-throated species, and the call is a “wehk, wehk, wehk” given in alarm.\n\n, ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/HylactesCastaneusSmit.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Pteroptochos_castaneus_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Chestnut-throated seedeater', 'The chestnut-throated seedeater (Sporophila telasco) is Neotropical songbird in the family Thraupidae.\nIt is found in along the western seaboard of South America, from southwestern Colombia to far northern Chile.\nThe natural habitats of the chestnut-throated seedeater are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, swamps, sandy shores, and heavily degraded former forest along the pacific coast and montane uplands of Western South America, primarily Ecuador, Peru and Chile.\nThe species serves as an indicator of declining forest health, as their populations appear to increase following deforestation and land use change.\nMales possess a rich chestnut patch on the throat in breeding season, while females share a similar color pattern, but lack the throat patch, with a lighter bill, but moult into drab plumage outside of the breeding season. This occurs because the cost of predator attracting, colorful plumage is no longer worth taking when breeding activities are completed.\nThese songbirds are among the smallest members of the tanager family at approximately 4.0 inches in length, and possess powerful bills to harvest grass seeds.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Chestnut-throatedSeedeater.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Tangara_fastuosa.jpg']), ('Chestnut-throated spinetail', 'The chestnut-throated spinetail (Synallaxis cherriei) is a species of bird in the family Furnariidae.
