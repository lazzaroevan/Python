[('Chenops', 'Chenops is an extinct genus of notostracan which existed in the Yixian Formation, Inner Mongolia, and the Jehol fauna of China during the early Cretaceous period (Barremian age). The genus was erected by Thomas A. Hegna and Ren Dong in 2010 to describe the Yixian species, Chenops yixianensis. A second species, originally described as Prolepidurus oblongus, from the Jehol fauna, was redescribed as C. oblongus.\nUnlike other notostracan genera like Triops and Lepidurus, Chenops lacked eyes.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Quetzalcoatlus07.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Chenops_yixianensis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Triops-longicaudatus-adult-ventral.jpg'])]
