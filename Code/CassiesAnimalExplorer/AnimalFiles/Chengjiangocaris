[('Chengjiangocaris', 'Chengjiangocaris is an extinct genus of a shrimp-like arthropod that lived during the Cambrian.  The genus is a type of fuxianhuiid, which are basal euarthropods. Five 520 million-year-old fossil specimens of C. kunmingensis were excavated in southern China and first reported in 2013 by Javier Ortega-Hern√°ndez and his colleagues.  One specimen shows detailed evidence of a nervous system, the fossil may be the oldest and most detailed example of a central nervous system yet identified, with even individual nerves -- rarely preserved soft tissue -- visible enough to study.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Chengjiangocaris_kunmingensis_fossil.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/20190910_Fuxianhuiid_Chengjiangocaris_Anterior.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg'])]
