[('Pyrophorus (beetle)', 'Pyrophorus (also known as fire beetles) is a genus of click beetle (family Elateridae). They are one of several genera in the tribe Pyrophorini, all of which are bioluminescent. Their bioluminescence is similar to that of another group of beetles, the fireflies, although click beetles do not flash, but remain constantly glowing (though they can control the intensity; for example, they become brighter when touched by a potential predator). They have two luminescent spots at the posterior corners of the pronotum, and another brighter light organ on the most-anterior surface of the ventral abdomen. This light organ is even brighter and can only be seen when in flight. Bioluminescent click beetles are found throughout tropical, subtropical and temperate America. Species from Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and Cuba are now in different genera in the tribe Pyrophorini, such as Deilelater and Ignelater.Adult Pyrophorus beetles feed on pollen and sometimes small insects, such as aphids or scale insects. Their larvae feed on various plant materials and invertebrates, including the larvae of other beetles. Eggs are luminous and are deposited either on or in the soil. Larvae, like eggs, are luminous. They grow slowly and pupate after an uncertain period of time, but perhaps several years after hatching.\nPyrophorus nyctophanus larvae live in tunnels in the outer layers of termite mounds on the cerrado of Brazil. During summertime they glow at night, attracting prey in the form of other insects.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Pyrophorus_noctilucus_click_beetle.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Pyrophorus noctilucus', 'Pyrophorus noctilucus, common name Headlight Elater, is a species of click beetle (family Elateridae).\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Pyrophorus_noctilucus_click_beetle.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Elateridae_-_Pyrophorus_noctilucus.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Plectrosternus_WIKI.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Pyrophorus nyctophanus', 'Pyrophorus nyctophanus (=fire-bearing night-shiner), aka headlight beetle or carbunco, is a species of click beetle that occurs on the cerrado of Brazil. Its luminescent larvae are either soil-dwelling or found in tunnels in the outer layers of termite mounds, and are active predators of other insects during summer nights when their regulated glow acts as a lure to their prey. The adult beetles, though, are phytophagous, feeding on decomposing plant matter and exudates, and are attracted to artificial light. Pupae of this genus also luminesce.\n\nHeadlight beetles are large click beetles notable among click beetles in their unique ability to produce light. An intense glow emanates from two round luminescent organs on the prothorax and a broad area on the underside of the first abdominal segment. In flight both sexes produce a brilliant blue-green streak of light that dazzles the onlooker. -Charles Leonard Hogue\nSome 26 species of Pyrophorus are found from southern Mexico to Argentina and the West Indies. The brightness of their light is legendary and Peter Martyr d\'Anghiera in his 1516 History of the West Indies notes that the Islanders tied a few beetles to their toes to light their way at night, but also spreads the myth that adult beetles feed on mosquitoes. Humboldt recorded that he read quite comfortably at night by the glow of a dozen beetles. West Indians also applied a paste made from crushed beetles to their faces and hands to appear ghostly in the dark.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Cerrado_ecoregion.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg']), ('Pyrophorus punctatissimus', 'Pyrophorus punctatissimus is a species of click beetle (family Elateridae).', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Plectrosternus_WIKI.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Elateridae_-_Pyrophorus_punctatissimus.JPG']), ('Pyrophorus tuberculifer', 'Pyrophorus tuberculifer is a species of click beetle (family Elateridae).\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Plectrosternus_WIKI.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Elateridae_-_Pyrophorus_tuberculifer.JPG'])]
