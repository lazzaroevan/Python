[('Kinda baboon', 'The Kinda baboon (Papio kindae) is a species of baboon present in the miombo woodlands of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, and possibly western Tanzania. While the Kinda baboon was once thought to be a subspecies of the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus), it has recently been discovered to be distinct enough to merit status as separate species (P. kindae) under the phylogenetic species concept.\n\nThe Kinda baboon is golden in color with a light build and slender, lanky appearance. Their fur is somewhat longer and is less coarse and much softer compared to other baboon species. It is the smallest of all baboons; adult males are about the size of adult females of other baboon species. The Kinda baboon is also characterized by a shorter snout and pink circles around the eyes. Infants are usually born with white hair rather than black, typical of other baboons. Sexual dimorphism in Kinda baboons is more moderate than in any other baboon subspecies.\n\nBaboons in between the size of the Kinda baboon and the yellow baboon are present in northeastern Zambia, and possibly in northern Malawi and southwestern Tanzania as well. Such a broad area of intergradation has been taken as evidence of substantial genetic exchange between the two taxa.\nThe Kinda baboon lives in multi-male and multi-female groups, similar to olive and yellow baboons, however, they are often much larger in size (often over 100 individuals). Compared to other baboon species, the Kinda baboon is unusually docile and uniquely characterized by high levels of male investment in male-female social relationships. Strict social hierarchy with female  permanent rank obtained from the mother was observed as in other species. Males join new groups and may rise in rank, but unlike other baboon species, violent confrontations are mostly avoided. More research is needed about its behavior.\nThe Kinda is named after the town in southern DRC where the type-locality was found.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Kinda_baboon_white_infant_with_mother.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Male_Kinda_baboon.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Female_kinda_baboon.jpg'])]
