[('Diphyidae', 'The Diphyidae are a family of siphonophores. These are colonial siphonophores with two nectophores (swimming bells) arranged one behind the other. The front one includes a somatocyst (extension of the gastrovascular system), while the hind one does not. The somatocyst often contains an oil droplet for buoyancy control. A nectosac (central cavity with muscular walls) in each nectophore allows the organism to swim efficiently.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Blaschka-Diphyes_sp.-Mus%C3%A9e_zoologique_de_Strasbourg.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
