[('Sylvirana', 'Sylvirana is a genus of true frogs, family Ranidae, found in South and East Asia, from northeastern India in west to China in the north, Taiwan in the east, and Thailand in the south. Originally proposed as a subgenus of Rana in 1992, it has been considered both a full genus and a synonym of Hylarana. Its current recognition at generic level stems from molecular genetic analyses published in 2015.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Rana_nigrovittata.jpg']), ('Sylvirana cubitalis', 'Sylvirana cubitalis is a species of frog in the family Ranidae.

It is found in the mountains of central and northeastern in Vietnam, Annamite Range in central Laos, and southern Guanxi, China. Its common name is Mao-Son frog or Maoson frog, after its type locality in Vietnam. It inhabits evergreen forests at elevations of 200–1,500 m (660–4,920 ft) above sea level. Individuals are typically found near streams on banks, leaf litter, and low in vegetation. Reproduction takes place in streams, ponds, and ditches. It is a locally common frog. Although International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not considered it threatened as a species, habitat loss and degradation are threats.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Grasfrosch.jpg']), ('Sylvirana mortenseni', Sylvirana mortenseni is a species of true frog. It is found in Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. The specific name mortenseni honours Ole Theodor Jensen Mortensen, the Danish zoologist who collected the holotype from the island of Koh Chang. Common names Mortensen's frog and Koh Chang Island frog have been proposed for it.Sylvirana mortenseni has been recorded in evergreen forest on the lower slopes of the mountains, gallery forest, and heavily disturbed areas and forest edge habitats. Clear-cutting of forests is a threat to it, although it appears to also inhabit disturbed areas., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Status_iucn3.1_NT.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Grasfrosch.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Hylarana-mortensenikhao-yai-national-park.jpg']), ('Sylvirana nigrovittata', 'Sylvirana nigrovittata, also known as the black-striped frog, black-spotted stream frog, sapgreen stream frog, etc., is a species of frog in the family Ranidae.

The species was redelimited in 2018, and earlier literature may refer to other species; identifications from India and Bangladesh are still uncertain.Sylvirana nigrovittata occurs in gentle streams in evergreen forest, including evergreen galleries in deciduous forest areas. The tadpoles develop quiet stream sections. It is a common species. It is threatened by the loss of forest canopy over streams it inhabits, as well as hydrological changes. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Hylarana_cf._nigrovittata.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Grasfrosch.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Rana_nigrovittata.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Hylarana_cf._nigrovittata_2.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg']), ('Sylvirana spinulosa', 'Hylarana spinulosa, also known as fine-spined frog and spiny frog, is a species of true frog, family Ranidae.

Breeding takes place in pools and slow-flowing streams.Hylarana spinulosa are medium-sized frogs: males grow to a snout–vent length of 40 mm (1.6 in) and females to 52 mm (2.0 in).
