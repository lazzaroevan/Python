[('Kimberella', Kimberella is an extinct genus of bilaterian known only from rocks of the Ediacaran period.  The slug-like organism fed by scratching the microbial surface on which it dwelt in a manner similar to the gastropods, although its affinity with this group is contentious.\nSpecimens were first found in Australia's Ediacara Hills, but recent research has concentrated on the numerous finds near the White Sea in Russia, which cover an interval of time from 555 to 558 million years ago. As with many fossils from this time, its evolutionary relationships to other organisms are hotly debated. Paleontologists initially classified Kimberella as a type of jellyfish, but since 1997 features of its anatomy and its association with scratch marks resembling those made by a radula have been interpreted as signs that it may have been a mollusc. Although some paleontologists dispute its classification as a mollusc, it is generally accepted as being at least a bilaterian.\nThe classification of Kimberella is important for scientific understanding of the Cambrian explosion: if it was a mollusc or at least a protostome, the protostome and deuterostome lineages must have diverged significantly before 555 million years ago. Even if it was a bilaterian but not a mollusc, its age would indicate that animals were diversifying well before the start of the Cambrian., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Kimberella.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Allosaurus_Jardin_des_Plantes.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Kimberella_trace.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Kimberella_reconstructions.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Kimberella_quadrata.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Kimberella_NT.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Cambrian_explosion_taskforce_logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Kimberella_blue.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg'])]
