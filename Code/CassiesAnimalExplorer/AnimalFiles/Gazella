[('Gazella borbonica', 'Gazella borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon gazelle or European gazelle, is an extinct gazelle which existed in Europe during the Pleistocene epoch. It was described by Charles Depéret in 1884.It had rather long, moderately divergent and slightly recurved horns and was about the same size as the modern Dorcas Gazelle, with a shoulder height of about 60 cm.Remains have been found in France, the Netherlands and south-east England. Taxonomic synonyms include Gazella anglica Newton, 1884 and Gazella daviesii Hinton, 1906.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Megaloceros_1856.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Gazella_borbonica.JPG']), ('Gazella harmonae', 'Gazella harmonae is an extinct gazelle which existed in what is now Ethiopia during the Pliocene epoch. It was described by Denis Geraads, René Bobe and Kaye Reed in 2012. Approximately the size of a living dorcas gazelle, the animal was noted for its unusual, spiral horn cores.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Megaloceros_1856.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Gazella praegaudryi', 'Gazella praegaudryi was a prehistoric, little known gazelle species that lived in Africa. It was small, and lived during the Pleistocene. It had little compressed horn cores and no forward turning metaconid of its P4.  Fossils have been excavated from formations such as at Fort Ternan, Lothagam, and Namulungle.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/7/74/20120404173704%21Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Gazella psolea', 'Gazella psolea is an unusual prehistoric species of gazelle that lived in Africa and Arabia; it is only known from fossils. It makes up the subgenus Deprezia due to its unique skull morphology: it had a long premolar row, and its nasal area is peculiar, with short nasal bones and a very large nasal opening. It therefore seems to have been able to breathe cold and dry air (a similar adaptation as found in the saiga), but why this feature evolved is still rather mysterious. Perhaps it made seasonal migrations to the High Atlas mountains, where such an adaptation would have been useful.\nThe species lived during the Late Pliocene (some 2.5 mya); its remains have been found at Ahl al Oughlam near Casablanca, Morocco.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Megaloceros_1856.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
