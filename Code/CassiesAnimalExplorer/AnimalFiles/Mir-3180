[('Mir-3180 microRNA precursor family', 'In molecular biology mir-3180 microRNA is a short RNA molecule. MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several mechanisms. The mir-10 microRNA precursor is a short non-coding RNA gene that is part of an RNA gene family which contains mir-3180-1, mir-3180-2, mir-3180-3, mir-3180-4 and mir-3180-5.  They have now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of cancers in humans. (MIPF0000894, mir-3180) mir-3180 has currently only been identified in human Homo sapiens.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Plain_DNA_icon.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Mir-3180_consensus_structure.png'])]
