[('Gopher', 'Pocket gophers, commonly referred to as just gophers, are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae. The roughly 35 species are all endemic to North and Central America.  They are commonly known for their extensive tunneling activities and their ability to destroy farms and gardens.\n\nThe name pocket gopher on its own may refer to any of a number of genera within the family Geomyidae. These are the true gophers, but several ground squirrels in the distantly related family Sciuridae are often called gophers, as well. The origin of the word gopher is uncertain; French gaufre, meaning waffle, has been suggested, on account of the gopher tunnels resembling the honeycomb-like pattern of holes in a waffle; another suggestion is that the word is of Muskogean origin.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Okapi2.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Pocket_gopher.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Pocket-Gopher_Ano-Nuevo-SP.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Attwater%E2%80%99s_Pockrt_Gopher_%285A%29_Weishuhn_Rd._Colorado_Co._TX%3B_12_May_2014.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
