[('Kinderen voor Kinderen', 'Kinderen voor Kinderen (Dutch pronunciation: [ˌkɪnd(ə)rə(n) voːr ˈkɪnd(ə)rə(n)]) is a Dutch children\'s choir maintained by public broadcaster BNNVARA. The name translates as children for children.\nSince 1980 the choir has released one album of new children\'s songs each year, and is probably the only act from the 1980s with consecutive albums in the  top 40 chart (apart from two releases). The ideas for the songs generally come from children who write in. Well-known Dutch lyricists then turn submitted ideas into finished songs.\nThe songs on each year\'s album are presented in a special TV broadcast, staged and recorded in advance (in the group\'s early years, these shows were broadcast live). Various Dutch celebrities often appear as cast members in these shows. In 2006, Kinderen voor Kinderen staged its first live pop concert as the basis of its annual broadcast.\nKinderen voor Kinderen also holds an annual Song Contest known as the Kinderen voor Kinderen Songfestival that sees the winners of the regional pre-selection rounds (one each province) compete against each other as finalists.\nThe group has used its current logo since the release of album 28 (De Gamer) in 2007. The logo, made up of cubes spelling out the group name, incorporates an exclamation mark on an angled cube. This is a distinguishing mark in the logo of the group\'s funder, public broadcaster VARA. The current KvK logo is a revision of a previous one, introduced in 1990 on their eleventh album, which featured an assortment of colored bouncing cubes to form the group name.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Flory_Anstadt_en_Kinderen_voor_Kinderen_%281982%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/KvKLogo2007.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg'])]
