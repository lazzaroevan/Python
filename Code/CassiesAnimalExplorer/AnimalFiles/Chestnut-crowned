[('Chestnut-crowned antpitta', 'The chestnut-crowned antpitta (Grallaria ruficapilla) is a species of bird in the family Grallariidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forest and heavily degraded former forest, which it has a much greater tolerance for than most antpittas. Usually this bird lives at elevations of 1,900 to 3,100 meters (6,200â€“10,200 ft).\nIt is mid-sized for an antpitta, averaging 18.5 centimeters (7.3 in) long. It has an orange-rufous head and nape. The back is olive brown and the throat is white. The belly is white overlaid with black-brown streaking, mainly on the sides and the flanks. The legs are gray-blue. This combination of field marks renders this species fairly distinctive when seen.\nThough shy and secretive like all Grallaria to some extent, this species hops into the open reasonably often, though rarely far from cover. Most often they range into open areas at or soon after dawn. In some areas, this species has become habituated to being fed worms, and in exchange can be watched by birdwatchers. The frequently heard song is often delivered from a slightly elevated perch and is loud, distinctive repeated wheuu.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Grallaria_ruficapilla_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Chestnut-crowned_Antpitta%2C_Rio_Blanco%2C_Colombia_%285746788680%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Grallaria_ruficapilla_-near_Manizales%2C_Caldas%2C_Colombia-8.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Chestnut-crowned babbler', 'The chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps) is a medium-sized bird that is endemic to arid and semi-arid areas of south-eastern Australia.

Though not considered migratory, it may make small seasonal movements to higher or lower elevations.The chestnut-crowned warbler was previously placed in the genus Seicercus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018 found that neither Phylloscopus nor Seicercus were monophyletic.
