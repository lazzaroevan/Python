[('Astylosternus batesi', 'Astylosternus batesi is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is found in Cameroon south of Sanaga River, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, southwestern Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, and the extreme western Democratic Republic of the Congo (Mayombe). The specific name batesi honours George Latimer Bates, an American naturalist.

It is typically associated with small streams in forest, or at higher altitudes (>2000 m), also along streams in montane grassland, sometimes bordered with trees. Astylosternus rheophilus tchabalensis is known with certainty only from Tchabal Nganha and occurs in relict gallery forests in a generally deforested area. Breeding takes place in streams.Astylosternus rheophilus is a very common species. Although it tolerates some habitat modification, widespread habitat loss and degradation are threats to it. Chytridiomycosis might pose an additional threat, at least in situations where populations are already stressed.

Common name Apouh night frog has been coined for this species (Apouh is the type locality).Astylosternus schioetzi occurs in lowland forests, in and near flowing water. Breeding takes place in small streams, including very small, superficial streams in marshy depressions.
