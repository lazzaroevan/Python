Adults are cream coloured with brown mottling and darker shades as well as a few black dots in the basal, medial and post medial areas on the forewings.\nThe larvae feed on a wide range of plants including Senecio species (including S. angulatus, S. tamoides and S. oxyodontus), Delairea odorata, Mikaniopsis cissampelina, Kleinia abyssinica, Carthamus tinctorius, Daucus carota and Bidens pilosa. They feed singly and moved to sheltered positions during the day. When disturbed, they drop off their host plant, curl up and remain motionless.
