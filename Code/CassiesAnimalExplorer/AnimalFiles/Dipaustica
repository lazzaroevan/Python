[('Dipaustica epiastra', 'Dipaustica epiastra is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is endemic to New Zealand. This moth was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1911. In 2019 Robert J. B. Hoare undertook a major review of New Zealand noctuids. Hoare synonymised Dipaustica with the genus Ichneutica and as a result this species is now known as Ichneutica epiastra.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Hadena_albimacula.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Dipaustica_epiastra_female.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Dipaustica_epiastra_male.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
