[('Diphyllobothrium', 'Diphyllobothrium is a genus of tapeworms which can cause diphyllobothriasis in humans through consumption of raw or undercooked fish. The principal species causing diphyllobothriasis is D. latum, known as the broad or fish tapeworm, or broad fish tapeworm. D. latum is a pseudophyllid cestode that infects fish and mammals. D. latum is native to Scandinavia, western Russia, and the Baltics, though it is now also present in North America, especially the Pacific Northwest. In Far East Russia, D. klebanovskii, having Pacific salmon as its second intermediate host, was identified.Other members of the genus Diphyllobothrium include D. dendriticum (the salmon tapeworm), which has a much larger range (the whole northern hemisphere), D. pacificum, D. cordatum, D. ursi, D. lanceolatum, D. dalliae, and D. yonagoensis, all of which infect humans only infrequently. In Japan, the most common species in human infection is D. nihonkaiense, which was only identified as a separate species from D. latum in 1986. More recently, a molecular study found D. nihonkaiense and D. klebanovskii to be a single species.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/D_latum_LifeCycle.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Diphyllobothrium_latum_egg.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Diphyllobothrium_latum_scolex_x40.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Diphyllobothrium_latum_proglottid.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Diphyl_proglottidE.JPG']), ('Diphyllobothrium dendriticum', 'Diphyllobothrium dendriticum is a large pseudophyllid cestode of the family Diphyllobothriidae.For many years D. dendriticum infection was neglected. Diphyllobothriasis is not a life-threatening disease and most human cases are mild or even asymptomatic. The original distribution of D. dendriticum is circumboreal, but it was also found in Argentina and Chile.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/CC-BY_icon.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/D_latum_LifeCycle.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/FMIB_51771_Median_segments_of_Dib_tyhrium_e_rdiceps.jpeg']), ('Diphyllobothrium elegans', 'Diphyllobothrium elegans is a species of tapeworms.

Infection with D. mansonoides in humans can result in sparganosis. Justus F. Mueller first reported this organism in 1935. D. mansonoides is similar to D. latum and Spirometra erinacei. When the organism was discovered, scientist did not know if D. mansonoides and S. erinacei were separate species. PCR analysis of the two worms has shown the two to be separate but closely related organisms.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20160612140736%21Question_book-new.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20171207131032%21Question_book-new.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20171208221057%21Question_book-new.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20201004174738%21Question_book-new.svg'])]
