[('Diorhabda carinata', Diorhabda carinata is a species of leaf beetle known as the larger tamarisk beetle (larger tamarisk beetle) which feeds on tamarisk trees from Ukraine, eastern Turkey and Syria east to northwest China, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan, extending as far south as southern Iran. It is used in North America as a biological pest control agent against  saltcedar or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), an invasive species in arid and semi-arid ecosystems (where the larger tamarisk beetle and its closely related sibling species also may be less accurately referred to as the 'saltcedar beetle', 'saltcedar leaf beetle', 'salt cedar leaf beetle', or 'tamarisk leaf beetle')., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/DiorhabdacarinataAshgTurkm.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Diorhabda elongata', Diorhabda elongata is a species of leaf beetle known as the Mediterranean tamarisk beetle (MTB) which feeds on tamarisk trees from Portugal and Algeria east to southern Russia. The MTB is used in North America as a biological pest control agent against saltcedar or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), an invasive species in arid and semi-arid ecosystems (where the MTB and its closely related sibling species are also less accurately referred to as the 'saltcedar beetle', 'saltcedar leaf beetle', 'salt cedar leaf beetle', or 'tamarisk leaf beetle') (Tracy and Robbins 2009)., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/DiorhabdaelongataCrete.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Diorhabda meridionalis', Diorhabda meridionalis is a species of leaf beetle known as the southern tamarisk beetle (SoTB) which feeds on tamarisk trees from Syria to western and southern Iran and southern Pakistan. The SoTB may have potential for use in North America as a biological pest control agent against saltcedar or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), an invasive species in arid and semi-arid ecosystems (where it might be less accurately referred to along with its closely related sibling species as the 'saltcedar beetle', 'saltcedar leaf beetle', 'salt cedar leaf beetle', or 'tamarisk leaf beetle') (Tracy and Robbins 2009)., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/DiorhabdameridionalisRaskIran.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Wikispecies-logo.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
