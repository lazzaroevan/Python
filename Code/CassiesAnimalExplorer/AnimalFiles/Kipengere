[('Kipengere seedeater', 'The Kipengere seedeater (Crithagra melanochroa), also known as the Tanzania seedeater, is a species of finch in the family Fringillidae.  It is found only in Tanzania.  Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forest and subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland.  It is threatened by habitat loss.\nThe Kipengere seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the Kipengere seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Carpodacus_mexicanus_-Madison_-Wisconsin_-USA-8-4cp.jpg'])]
