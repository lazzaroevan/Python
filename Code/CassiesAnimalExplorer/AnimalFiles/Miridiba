[('Miridiba', 'Miridiba is a genus of beetle in the family Scarabaeidae, which are well known as white-grubs for their white larvae that are found under the soil where they feed on the roots of plants. The antennae end in a short club (shorter than the basal stalk). The mandible has a wrinkled molar lobe and the incisor lobe is depressed above. The lib or labrum is depressed in the middle. Species within this genus are found in the Old World mainly in eastern and tropical Asia. Some species in the genus were earlier considered as Holotrichia.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Miridiba.jpg'])]
