[('Gharial', 'The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), also known as the gavial or the fish-eating crocodile, is a crocodilian in the family Gavialidae and among the longest of all living crocodilians. Mature females are 2.6–4.5 m (8 ft 6 in–14 ft 9 in) long, and males 3–6 m (9 ft 10 in–19 ft 8 in). They have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ghara, hence the name gharial. The gharial is a piscivore and is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, thin snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth.\nThe gharial probably evolved in the northern Indian subcontinent. Fossil gharial remains were excavated in Pliocene deposits in the Sivalik Hills and the Narmada River valley. It currently inhabits rivers in the plains of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian, and leaves the water only for basking and building nests on moist sandbanks. Adults mate at the end of the cold season. Females congregate in spring to dig nests. They lay 20–95 eggs, and guard the nests and the young that hatch before the onset of the monsoon. The hatchlings stay and forage in shallow water during their first year, but move to sites with deeper water as they grow.\nThe wild gharial population has declined drastically since the 1930s, and is limited to only 2% of its historical range today. Conservation programmes initiated in India and Nepal focused on reintroducing captive-bred gharials since the early 1980s. Loss of habitat because of sand mining and conversion to agriculture, depletion of fish resources and detrimental fishing methods continue to threaten the population. It has been listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2007.\nThe oldest known depictions of the gharial are about 4,000 years old and were found in the Indus Valley. Hindus regard it as the vehicle of the river deity Gaṅgā. Local people living near rivers attributed mystical and healing powers to the gharial, and used some of its body parts as ingredients of indigenous medicine.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Indian_Gharial_at_the_San_Diego_Zoo_%282006-01-03%29_%28headshot%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Babur_crossing_the_river_Son.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Indian_Gharial_Crocodile_Digon3.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Mother_and_Chilld.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Gharial_distribution2019.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Status_iucn3.1_CR.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Crocodylus_cataphractus_faux-gavial_d%27Afrique2_white_background.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Gharial_in_Karnali.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Gavialis_gangeticus_%28Gharial%2C_Gavial%29_white_background.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Siamese_Crocodile_white_background.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Bristol.zoo.westafrican.dwarf.croc.arp._white_background.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Gharial_%28Gavialis_gangeticus%29_female.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Baby_Gharial.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Co-existence_of_Rarities.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Gavial_Skeleton.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Gharial_%28Gavialis_gangeticus%29_female_head.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Gharial_%28Gavialis_gangeticus%29_male.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Gharial_Crocodiles_-_Conservation_Breeding_Center_-_Kasara_-_Chitwan_National_Park_-_Nepal_-_01_%2813907486606%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Tomistoma_schlegelii._white_background.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Big_Mama_National_Chambal_sanctuary_01.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg'])]
