[('Symmoriiformes', 'Symmoriiformes is an extinct order of holocephalians. Originally named Symmoriida by Zangerl (1981), it has subsequently been known by several other names. Lund (1986) synonymized the group with Cladodontida, while Maisey (2008) corrected the name to Symmoriiformes in order to prevent it from being mistaken for a family. The symmoriiform fossils record appear at the beginning of the Carboniferous. Most of them died out at the start of the Permian, but Dwykaselachus is known from the Artinskian-Kungurian of South Africa. However, teeth described from the Valanginian of France and Austria indicates that members of the family Falcatidae might have survived until the Early Cretaceous.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Steth_pair1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Akmonistion_NT_small.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Symmorium1DB.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Stethacanthus1DB.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Falcatus.jpg'])]
