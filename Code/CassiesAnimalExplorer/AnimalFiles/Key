[('Key Largo cotton mouse', The Key Largo cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus allapaticola) is a subspecies of the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) and is found on Key Largo in the upper Florida Keys. It is a slightly larger mouse with a more reddish color than other mouse species from peninsular\nFlorida. Key Largo cotton mice can breed throughout the year and have an average life expectancy of 5 months. While the cotton mouse is one of the most common small mammals in South Florida, the Key Largo cotton mouse subspecies is endemic to Key Largo, and currently restricted to the northernmost part, due to habitat destruction. The Key Largo cotton mouse is currently on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species, due to urbanization of Key Largo. This cotton mouse subspecies can reach a body length of seven inches (17.9 centimeters) with a tail length of 3.0 in (7.7 cm).  Key Largo cotton mice have a dark hazel back with reddish-brown sides, a white belly, white feet, and a tail that is brown on top and white on the bottom. It is on the Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species, due to the urbanization of Key Largo. The species previously resided in a variety of tropical hardwood habitats, but urbanization has decimated these areas, reducing the availability of food, shelter, and habitat for the cotton mouse. Surveys show that the Key Largo cotton mouse has lost up to 50% of its habitat due to this urbanization. The remaining habitat of the Key Largo cotton mouse is fragmented, making reproduction and population growth more difficult.  Urbanization resulted in many other threats to the Key Largo cotton mouse, such as domesticated animals, human trash, and climate factors (hurricanes and rising sea level). Suggested actions to support the growth of the Key Largo cotton mouse populations and downgrade its listing from endangered to threatened include expanding public awareness and limiting pollution in the area., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Status_ESA_LE.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Key_Largo_Cotton_Mouse_Distribution_Map.jpg']), ('Key Largo woodrat', 'The Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli), a subspecies of the eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana), is a medium-sized rat found on less than 2,000 acres  of the northern area of Key Largo, Florida, in the United States. It is currently on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species. The rat grows to 260 grams and feeds on fruit, leaves and buds.

The species itself harbors a unique genetic diversity and adaptive potential. Numerous observations and recent studies agree that there is the necessity of managing key silversides as a separate management unit. It has been recently recommended for threatened status by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The species is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern.  Species of Concern are those species about which the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA)., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Status_iucn3.1_EN.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Menidia_peninsulae.jpg']), ('Key tegu', 'The Key tegu (Echinosaura keyi ) is a species of lizard in the family Gymnophthalmidae.
