[('Mir-19 microRNA precursor family', There are 89 known sequences today in the microRNA 19 (miR-19) family but it will change quickly. They are found in a large number of vertebrate species. The miR-19 microRNA precursor is a small non-coding RNA molecule that regulates gene expression. Within the human and mouse genome there are three copies of this microRNA that are processed from multiple predicted precursor hairpins:\nmouse:* miR-19a on chromosome 14 (MI0000688)\n* miR-19b-1 on chromosome 14 (MI0000718)\n* miR-19b-2 on chromosome X (MI0000546)human:* miR-19a on chromosome 13 (MI0000073)\n* miR-19b-1 on chromosome 13 (MI0000074)\n* miR-19b-2 on chromosome X (MI000075).MiR-19 has now been predicted or experimentally confirmed  (MIPF0000011). In this case the mature sequence is excised from the 3' arm of the hairpin precursor., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RF00245.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/3/36/20090623085631%21RF00245.jpg'])]
