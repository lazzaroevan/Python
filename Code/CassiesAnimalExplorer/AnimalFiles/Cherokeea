[('Cherokeea', 'Cherokeea attakullakulla is a moth in the family Noctuidae and the only species in the genus Cherokeea. It is found in North Carolina (Swain and Macon Counties in the mountains and Rutherford County in the foothills) and Georgia (Rabun County).\nThe length of the forewings is 9.8â€“11.7 mm. The forewings are variable, ranging from nearly uniform dull grey to much more contrasting and mottled, especially in females. The antemedial line is excurved, doubled, with pale grey to nearly white filling. It is slightly scalloped and composed of black scales. The medial line or shade is obscure and the postmedial line is sinuous. The basal, medial and terminal areas are predominantly uniform grey, with some reddish-brown scaling in the medial and basal areas in some individuals. The hindwings are pale grey and unmarked except for a faint discal spot. There are two patterns of maculation, mottled and plain. Intermediates are seen as well. Adults have been recorded on wing in June. There is one generation per year.\nThe larvae probably feed on Arundinaria appalachiana.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Cherokeea_attakullakulla_female.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Hadena_albimacula.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Cherokeea_attakullakulla_male.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
