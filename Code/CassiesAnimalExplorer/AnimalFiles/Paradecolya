[('Paradecolya briseferi', 'Paradecolya briseferi is a species of katydid endemic to the islands of Mauritius, where it only occurs in a single area of 4 km2 in a preserved forest. Due to its small range and the continuing decline of its habitat, it is assessed as a critically endangered species. The main threat to P. briseferi is the decline of the native forests of Mauritius due to the gradual destruction by clearance and non-native invasive plant species. The species occurs in the oldest managed area in the Brise Fer Nature Reserve which is the best preserved relict of the native Sapotaceae forest.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Status_iucn3.1_CR.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Paradecolya inexspectata', 'Paradecolya inexspectata is a species of insect, belonging to the family of  Tettigonioidea.\nThis species is known from La RÃ©union.
