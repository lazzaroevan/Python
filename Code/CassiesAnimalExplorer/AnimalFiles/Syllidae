[('Syllidae', 'Syllidae is a family of small to medium-sized polychaete worms. Syllids are distinguished from other polychaetes by the presence of a muscular region of the anterior digestive tract known as the proventricle.Syllid worms range in size from 2–3 mm (0.08–0.12 in) to 14 centimetres (5.5 in).  Most syllids are benthic organisms that transition to a pelagic epitoke for reproduction.  They are found in all regions of the ocean, from the intertidal zone to the deep sea, and are especially abundant in shallow water.They are found in a range of habitats, moving actively on rock and sandy substrates, hiding in crevices and among seaweeds, and climbing on sponges, corals, hydrozoans, seagrasses and mangroves. They are generalist feeders.One species in the family, Syllis ramosa, was the first polychaete discovered to have a branching body plan.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Syllis_gracilis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Nerr0328.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Syllid_polychaete_undergoing_epitoky.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg'])]
