[('Symphurus', 'Symphurus is a genus of fish in the family Cynoglossidae found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean. Most species mainly occur in relatively shallow water, including estuaries. Some species are also found in deeper water, including S. thermophilus that lives at hydrothermal vents (the only flatfish known from this habitat). These species are distinguished by merged dorsal, caudal and anal fins, the absence of a lateral line and pectoral fins, and the presence of only one pelvic fin. They are sinistral flatfishes, meaning that as adults, their crania are asymmetrical, with both eyes on the left side. The largest species grows to about 32 cm (1 ft) long.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Symphurus_ommaspilus_-_pone.0010676.g190.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Symphurus_arawak_-_pone.0010676.g189.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Symphurus pusillus', 'The northern tonguefish (Symphurus pusillus) is a species of fish belonging to the family Cynoglossidae.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Symphurus_pusillus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']), ('Symphurus thermophilus', 'Symphurus thermophilus is a species of tonguefish notable for being the only flatfish known to be an obligate inhabitant of hydrothermal vents. It is known from several widely dispersed locations in the western Pacific Ocean and occurs in great numbers. They are tolerant of harsh conditions and are often found in close association with elemental sulfur, including molten sulfur pools that exceed 180 Â°C in temperature. As they are not significantly different in appearance and feeding habits from other tonguefishes, they are thought to be relatively recent colonizers of vent ecosystems.These fish were first observed in nature in 1988, and were provisionally assigned to the species Symphurus orientalis before being recognized as a new species. The species name thermophilus is from the Greek thermos meaning heat and philos meaning lover, referring to its association with hydrothermal vents.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Symphurus_thermophilus_rangemap.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Nikko_sulfur_crust.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Symphurus_thermophilus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Symphurus_thermophilus3.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Symphurus_thermophilus2.jpg'])]
