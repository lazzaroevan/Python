[('Chestnut-backed antbird', 'The chestnut-backed antbird (Poliocrania exsul) is a passerine bird in the antbird family. It is found in humid forests in Central and South America (Chocó-Magdalena), ranging from eastern Nicaragua to western Ecuador. It mainly occurs in lowlands up to an altitude of 900 metres (3,000 ft) m, but locally it occurs higher.\nThis is a common bird in the understory thickets of wet forest, especially at edges, along streams and in old treefall clearings, and in adjacent tall second growth.  The female lays two purple or red-brown spotted white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes, in an untidy cup nest which is constructed from vines, plant fibre and dead leaves and placed low in vegetation. The male and female parents both feed the chicks.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Chestnut-backed_Antbird%2C_El_Paujil%2C_Cololmbia_%285746230497%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Chestnut_backed_Antbird.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Poliocrania_exsul_map.svg']), ('Chestnut-backed antshrike', 'The chestnut-backed antshrike (Thamnophilus palliatus) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae.

It is a permanent resident within its range, with some seasonal movements as feeding flocks move short distances in search of food. They usually move to lower elevations in the same area upon onset of winter and move back up to higher elevations in late summer.\nChickadees are able to use nocturnal hypothermia to regulate energy expenditure, allowing them to survive harsh winters where other bird species not utilizing thermal regulation would not be able to. Some estimates put the energy conserved while using nocturnal hypothermia all the way up to 32%.\n\nIt is a small chickadee, 11.5–12.5 cm (4.5–4.9 in) long with a weight of 8.5–12.6 g (0.30–0.44 oz). The head is dark blackish-brown with white cheeks, the mantle is bright rufous-brown, the wing feathers are dark gray with paler fringes. The underparts are white to pale grayish-white, with rufous or pale gray flanks. It is often considered the most handsome of all chickadees. They often move through the forest in mixed feeding flocks, and are often seen in large groups with bushtits and warblers.\nThere are three subspecies, with the flanks being grayer and less rufous further south:\nPoecile rufescens rufescens (Townsend, 1837). Alaska south to northwest California. Broad rufous band on flanks.\nPoecile rufescens neglectus (Ridgway, 1879). Coastal central California (Marin County). Narrow rufous band on flanks.\nPoecile rufescens barlowi (Grinnell, 1900). Coastal southwestern California (south of San Francisco Bay). Almost no rufous color on flanks.\nIts habitat is low elevation coniferous and mixed coniferous forests. In the San Francisco Bay Area this bird has readily adapted to suburban settings, prompting a range expansion. It is a cavity-nester, usually utilizing an abandoned woodpecker hole, but sometimes excavating on its own. Chestnut-backed chickadees use much fur and hair to make their nests. Their nests are actually 50% fur and hair. The most common hair they use comes from deer, rabbits, and coyotes. The adult chickadees also make a layer of fur about a centimeter thick which is used to cover the eggs on the nest whenever they leave the nest. It lays 5–8 (sometimes 9) eggs per clutch.\nIts food is largely insects and other invertebrates gleaned from foliage. Chestnut-backed chickadees take some seeds, especially those of conifers, and fruit. It will visit bird feeders, including hummingbird feeders, and especially loves suet.\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the chestnut-backed chickadee is sister to the boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus).', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Chestnut-backed_Chickadee_2.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Chestnut-backed_Chickadee.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Poecile_rufescens_distribution_map.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Poecile_rufescens.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Parus_rufescensDU1N028CA.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Chestnut-backed jewel-babbler', 'The chestnut-backed jewel-babbler (Ptilorrhoa castanonota) is a species of bird in the family Psophodidae.\nIt is found in New Guinea.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Eupetes_castanonotus_-_The_Birds_of_New_Guinea_%28cropped%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Chestnut-backed laughingthrush', 'The chestnut-backed laughingthrush (Pterorhinus nuchalis) is a species of bird in the family Leiothrichidae.
