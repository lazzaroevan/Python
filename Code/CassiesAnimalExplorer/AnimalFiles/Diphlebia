[('Diphlebia euphoeoides', 'Diphlebia euphoeoides, sometimes spelled Diphlebia euphaeoides, known as the tropical rockmaster, is an Australian species of broad winged damselfly.\nIt is one of a group known as the azure damselflies. It is found in Queensland (Australia) and Papua New Guinea. It typically occurs near lakes, waterfalls or streams at relatively low altitudes, and is occasionally seen near dry pools.Unusually for damselflies, it is a relatively large insect with its wings outspread at rest. It is often confused with dragonflies, although like most damselflies, the form is not as robust as dragonflies, and the eyes do not meet as with most dragonflies. Larvae are wide and flat, with long saccoid gills to breathe underwater. The inner tooth of labial palps is elongated. The specific characters of the larva are mid-ventral, distal width, basal width, and length of median lobe. Larval motor patterns were similar to larvae in the Coenagrionidae.The male tropical rockmaster has a bright blue and black body with dark wings. It can be distinguished from the sapphire rockmaster (Diphlebia coerulescens) by the smaller size of blue markings at the base (front end) and underside of terga 4 to 6. Its abdomen is otherwise black. Its wings are the widest in the genus, and the hindwings are wider than the forewings. The legs are brownish black. The female tropical rockmaster is predominantly brown and yellow-green, and also has smoky-coloured wings.The transformation from egg to adult is through an incomplete metamorphosis. Like the adult form, the nymph is also a predator. Eggs are laid underwater on moss and reeds around November. The nymphal phase lasts for approximately one year. Adults usually emerge in September and October.  It is an uncommon species, though not considered under threat. It was described in 1907 by a young English-born entomologist, Robin Tillyard. He had collected the lectotype at Mervyn Creek in Queensland in January 1905. Forster collected what is now classified as the same species from around Port Moresby in New Guinea in 1910 and named it Diphlebia reinholdi.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Diphlebia_euphoeoides_distribution_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Diphlebia_euphoeoides_male_wings_%2833984888534%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Diphlebia_euphoeoides_1716-7.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Diphlebia_euphoeoides_female_wings_%2834788174726%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Tropical_Rockmaster_-_Cairns_Australia.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Diphlebia coerulescens', 'Diphlebia coerulescens, known as the sapphire rockmaster, is an Australian species of broad winged damselfly.\nIt is one of a group known as the azure damselflies. It is found in Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales in eastern Australia, where it is found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.English-born entomologist, Robin Tillyard described the sapphire rockmaster as a subspecies of the tropical rockmaster, Diphlebia euphaeoides in 1913, before reassessing it as a separate species on the basis of the distinct shape of the male anal appendage, as well as differences in size and colour of the adults.The male sapphire rockmaster has a mostly bright blue and black body with dark wings. It can be distinguished from the tropical rockmaster by the larger size of two prominent blue markings at the base (front end) and underside of terga 4 to 6. Its upperside abdomen of its otherwise black abdomen often has blue markings to the front ends of the terga. The wings are narrower than the tropical rockmaster, but wider than the other members of the genus, and are a smoky brown rather than black. The legs are mostly brownish black, but have some blue on the upper mid and hind femurs. The female sapphire rockmaster is predominantly brown and olive-green, and also has smoky-coloured wings. Its legs are dark brown with light brown upper segments of mid and hind femurs. The upperside of its abdomen is a dark olive-green, with a darker dorsal line prominently running down the midline, which widens into a roughly triangular pattern at the rear end of each segment (tergum).', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Diphlebia_coerulescens_distribution_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Diphlebia_coerulescens_male_wings_%2834788170596%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Pale_blue_damselfly_bum_up_from_behind_%2816228598862%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Pale_blue_damselfly_flank_%2816043282799%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Amber_with_black_damselfly_shoulder_%2815606931484%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Pale_blue_damselfly_lateral_wings_up_%2815609547813%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Pale_blue_damselfly_cheek_%2815606979714%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Amber_with_black_danselfly_flank_%2816041839048%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Diphlebia_coerulescens_female_wings_%2834788166926%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Blue_damselfly_lateral_%2816096715076%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Diphlebia euphoeoides', 'Diphlebia euphoeoides, sometimes spelled Diphlebia euphaeoides, known as the tropical rockmaster, is an Australian species of broad winged damselfly.\nIt is one of a group known as the azure damselflies.
