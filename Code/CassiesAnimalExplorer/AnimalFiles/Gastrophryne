[('Gastrophryne', 'Gastrophryne, the narrowmouth toads (also American narrowmouth toads, North American narrow-mouthed toads), is a genus of microhylid frogs found in the Americas between Honduras and southern United States.\nIts name means ‘belly-toad’, referring to its large belly, from the Ancient Greek gastēr (γαστήρ, ‘belly, stomach’) and phrunē (φρύνη, ‘toad’).Gastrophryne is closely related to Hypopachus. Some species that were earlier placed in Gastrophryne were more closely related to Hypopachus, rendering the genus paraphyletic. This has been rectified by moving some species (Gastrophryne usta and Gastrophryne pictiventris) to Hypopachus.Gastrophryne frogs were the first species to be recognized to be experiencing speciation by reinforcement and lead to the coining of the term reinforcement by W. Frank Blair in 1955; a concept proposed by Theodosius Dobzhansky decades earlier.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Kaloula_taprobanica_-_Salt_Lake_City_-_Kolkata_2012-08-16_0763.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Gastrophryne_carolinensis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Gastrophryne_olivacea%2C_Western_Narrow-mouthed_Toad%2C_Tamaulipas.jpg']), ('Gastrophryne carolinensis', 'Gastrophryne carolinensis, the eastern narrow-mouthed toad, is a species of microhylid frog. It is a relatively small, toad-like amphibian found in damp, shady habitats. The species is highly fossorial, and feeds primarily on ants. These North American microhylids (Family: Microhylidae) are distinguished from true toads (genus Bufo), and other anurans by their moist, smooth skin, their lack of eardrums or tympana, their distinguishable squat body shape, and the unique fold of skin superior to their eyes. It is found in the United States, from southern Maryland to the Florida Keys, west to Missouri and Texas. While not a true toad, it is so called because it is terrestrial.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Gastrophryne_carolinensis_call.webm', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Gastrophryne_carolinensis_UMFS_2014_1.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Gastrophryne_carolinensis_eggs.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Gastrophryne_carolinensis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Eastern_Narrow-mouth_Toad%2C_%28Gastrophryne_carolinensis%29_Liberty_Co._Texas._photo_by_W._L._Farr.jpg']), ('Gastrophryne elegans', 'Gastrophryne elegans, the elegant narrow-mouthed toad, is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae found in Central America.
