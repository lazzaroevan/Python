[('Symphysanodon', 'Symphysanodon, also known as the slopefishes, is a genus of small marine fishes. Most are found in the Indo-Pacific, but three species, S. berryi, S. mona, and S. octoactinus, are found in the Western Atlantic. They are found on rocky reefs at depths of 50–700 m (160–2,300 ft). Traditionally, this genus is the only member of the family Symphysanodontidae, but in 2017 a new species, C. aureolateralis, was placed in its own genus Cymatognathus.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Abborre%2C_Iduns_kokbok.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/KawariHDyg.jpg'])]
