[('Paracyrba', 'Paracyrba is a genus of jumping spiders found only in Malaysia. It contains only one species, Paracyrba wanlessi. Its microhabitat are the water-filled hollow internodes of decaying bamboo, where it preys for aquatic animals, especially mosquito larvae. P. wanlessi and Evarcha culicivora, a jumping spider, are the only two spiders that have been experimentally studied and considered a mosquito specialist. E. culicivora indirectly feeds vertebrate blood by preying female mosquitos that carry blood. In general only one specimen is found per occupied bamboo internode.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/7/74/20120404173704%21Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
