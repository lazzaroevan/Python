[('Kinosternoidea', 'Kinosternoidea is a superfamily of aquatic turtles, which includes two families: Dermatemydidae, and Kinosternidae.\nKinosternoids are cryptodires, turtles whose necks are able to retract within their shell. Molecular studies suggest they are likely the sister group to the snapping turtles of the family Chelydridae. They are also omnivorous, oviparous, phosphatic, and actively mobile.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sternotherus_odoratus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Turtleicon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png'])]
