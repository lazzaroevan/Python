[('Cheloniellida', 'Cheloniellida is a taxon (usually referred to as an order) of extinct Paleozoic arthropods. As of 2018, 8 monotypic genera of cheloniellids had been formally described, whose fossils are found in marine strata ranging from Ordovician to Devonian in age. Cheloniellida has a controversial phylogenetic position, with previous studies associated it as either a member or relative of various fossil and extant arthropod taxa. It was later accepted as a member of Vicissicaudata within Artiopoda.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/20200615_Cheloniellon_calmani_anterior_ventral_abbreviation.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Cheloniellid.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Xus_yus.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/20200615_Cheloniellon_calmani_anterior_ventral.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/20200415_Cheloniellon_calmani.png'])]
