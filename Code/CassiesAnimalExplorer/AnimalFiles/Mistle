[('Mistle thrush', The mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus) is a bird common to much of Europe, temperate Asia and North Africa. It is a year-round resident in a large part of its range, but northern and eastern populations migrate south for the winter, often in small flocks. It is a large thrush with pale grey-brown upper parts, a greyish-white chin and throat, and black spots on its pale yellow and off-white under parts. The sexes are similar in plumage, and its three subspecies show only minimal differences. The male has a loud, far-carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather, earning the bird the old name of stormcock.\nFound in open woods, parks, hedges and cultivated land, the mistle thrush feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits include those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.\nThe open cup nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against potential predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically of three to five eggs, is incubated for 12–15 days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16 days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.\n\n, ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Ixodus_ricinus_5x.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Mistle_Thrush_%28Turdus_viscivorus%29_%28W1CDR0000636_BD11%29.ogg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Mistlethrushbonna.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Turdus_viscivorus_-Longbridge%2C_Birmingham%2C_England_-parent_and_chicks-8_%282%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Turdus_viscivorus_in_Baikonur-town_001.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/TurdusViscivorusIUCN2019_2.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Viscum_album_fruit.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Mistle_trush_male_left_pass_earthworms_to_female.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Turdus_viscivorus_in_Baikonur-town_003.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg'])]
