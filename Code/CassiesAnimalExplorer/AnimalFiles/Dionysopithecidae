[('Dionysopithecidae', Dionysopithecidae is an extinct family of fossil catarrhines and the earliest-known and most primitive members of the Pliopithecoidea superfamily, with fossils in Sihong in China dating to 18â€“17 million years ago for species Dionysopithecus shuangouensis and Platodontopithecus jianghuaiensis.A single lower molar found in Ban San Klang in Thailand is similar to those found in Sihong but sufficiently different to be considered a different species, Dionysopithecus orientalis.They are sometimes treated as a subfamily of Pliopithecidae as 'Dionysopithecinae'., ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Mesopropithecus_globiceps_skull_001.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg'])]
