[('Cherax', 'Cherax is the most widespread genus of fully aquatic crayfish in the Southern Hemisphere. Together with Euastacus, it is also the largest crayfish genus in the Southern Hemisphere. Its members may be found in lakes, rivers, and streams across most of Australia and New Guinea. In Australia, the many species of Cherax are commonly known as yabbies.  The most common and widely distributed species in Australia is the common yabby (C. destructor).  It is generally found in lowland rivers and streams, lakes, swamps, and impoundments at low to medium altitude, largely within the Murray–Darling Basin. Common yabbies are found in many ephemeral waterways, and can survive dry conditions for long periods of time (at least several years) by aestivating (lying dormant) in burrows sunk deep into muddy creek and swamp beds. In New Guinea, Cherax crayfish are found widely in rivers, streams, and lakes, with a particularly high diversity in the Paniai Lakes. New Guinea is also home to the only known cave-living crayfish in the Southern Hemisphere, C. acherontis. Some species are very colourful and sometimes seen in the freshwater aquarium trade.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Cherax_distribution.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Jielbeaumadier_ecrevisse_2_vda_2011.jpeg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Cherax_destructor_%28Cyan_yabby%29.jpg']), ('Cherax albidus', 'Cherax albidus, commonly known as the white yabby, is an Australian freshwater crustacean in the Parastacidae family, found primarily in Western Australian agricultural dams.

It is one of the smallest species in the genus. No species of Cherax has been considered endemic to wet upland or highland areas before it was discovered; most previous records were from elevations less than 400 meters.
