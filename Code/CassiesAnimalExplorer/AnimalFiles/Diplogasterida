[('Diplogasterida', 'Diplogasterida was an order of nematodes. It was sometimes placed in a monotypic subclass Diplogasteria, but molecular phylogenetic evidence has shown it to be embedded in the family Rhabditidae (formerly Rhabditina). The confusion of having a hierarchical nesting of groups that were formerly mutually exclusive has led to a profusion of names. Although completely revised taxonomy of nematodes that builds on recent classification systems as well as recent phylogenetic evidence is still necessary, most contemporary taxonomic studies now treat all groups listed under Diplogasterina below as a single family, Diplogastridae.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Pristionchus_pacificus_g001_%281%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Celegans_wt_nhr80rnai.png'])]
