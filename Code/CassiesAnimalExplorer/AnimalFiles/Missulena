[('Missulena', 'Missulena is a genus of mygalomorph spiders in the family Actinopodidae, sometimes called mouse spiders. It was first described by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1805. M. tussulena is found in Chile, but the rest are indigenous to Australia.The term mouse spider comes from the now-disproven belief that they dig deep burrows similar to those of mice. Scotophaeus blackwalli also shares the common name mouse spider, but is actually quite different. It is in a different family, is not a mygalomorph, is much smaller, looks very different, and is not considered dangerous.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Mouse_spider02.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Male_Missulena_occatoria_spider_-_cropped.JPG']), ('Missulena bradleyi', 'Missulena bradleyi, also known as the eastern mouse spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae. The spider is endemic to the eastern coast of Australia.William Joseph Rainbow described the eastern mouse spider in 1914 from a specimen collected in North Sydney by Henry Horton Burton Bradley (1845â€“1918), president of the board of trustees of the Australian Museum at the time. Describing the beautiful and strikingly marked specimen as a decided novelty, Rainbow named it in honour of its collector, whom he stated was the first collector of Australian spiders.\n\nEastern mouse spiders are often mistaken for Australian funnel-web spiders. The females are large and very strong, with powerful chelicerae. Their fangs often cross over slightly, while those of Australian funnel-web spiders remain parallel, and the latter often have a drop of venom on their fang tips and have longer spinnerets.\nThe male, which has an all-black carapace and a pale bluish area on top of the abdomen, roams around in autumn and early winter looking for a mate. They sometimes fall into swimming pools when wandering. Cases of envenomations have peaked during this period.Males have a trapezium-shaped lighter patch that can be colored from white and pale blue to mauve while females have abdomens that are colored brown to almost black. Both sexes have a carapace that is a shiny black color.The burrow can be found by brushing away loose soil in an area where they live until a flap of silk indicative of the entrance is found.\n\nCommon symptoms of eastern mouse spider bites are numbness and tingling at the bite site, sweating (diaphoresis), headache, and nausea generally. Although it appears to be the most dangerous member of the genus, serious envenomations by this species are relatively rare. Most bites documented in the medical literature did not require use of antivenom nor involve serious symptoms. Their venom has been found to have toxins similar to the robustoxin found in Australian funnel-web spider venom, and Australian funnel-web spider antivenom has been found to be effective in treating severe mouse spider bites. Compared to the Australian funnel-web spider, however, the eastern mouse spider is far less aggressive towards humans, and may often give dry bites.\n\n', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Mygalomorphae_Actinopodidae_Missulena_bradleyi_Eastern_Mouse_Spider_The_Gap_Brisbane_001.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Mouse_spider.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/AustralianMuseum_spider_specimen_41.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Missulena insignis', 'Missulena insignis, commonly known as the lesser red-headed mouse spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae native to Australia.

It is the largest (females up to 24 mm, males up to 12 mm) and most widely distributed Missulena species, because the spiderlings are wind-dispersed (ballooning). Normally this only occurs with araneomorph spiders, mygalomorph spiders normally disperse by walking. Missulena venom may be very toxic, but few cases of serious envenomation have been recorded. Most recorded bites only caused minor effects, with Australian funnel-web spider antivenom having proved effective as a treatment.The spiders dig a burrow up to 55 cm deep, with two trapdoors.\nWhile the females are black with a red tinge, the males have a bright red head and jaws, and a gunmetal blue-black abdomen.', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Distribution.missulena.occatoria.1.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Male_Missulena_occatoria_spider_-_cropped.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/AustralianMuseum_spider_specimen_43.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg']), ('Missulena pruinosa', 'Missulena pruinosa, commonly known as the northern mouse spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae, native to Australia (Western Australia, Northern Territory).', ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Mouse_spider.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png']), ('Missulena torbayensis', 'Missulena torbayensis is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae.
